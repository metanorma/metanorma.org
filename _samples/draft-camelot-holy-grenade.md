                    The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch
                     draft-camelot-holy-grenade-01

Abstract

   The menagerie of beasts and artefacts depicted in RFC8140 may be
   usefully supplemented by other renowned figures of Internet and more
   general lore.  This document extends the menagerie to the seminal
   fable of the "Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch", as depicted in the Monty
   Python film "Monty Python and the Holy Grail", as well as "Spamalot",
   the musical inspired by the movie.

Spamalot

   The relevance of the musical "Spamalot" to Internet lore should be
   obvious to the reader; but in case of doubt, see also Section 1
   ("What is Spam*?") of RFC2635.

1.  Terminology

   The key words "*MUST*", "*MUST NOT*", "*REQUIRED*", "*SHALL*",
   "*SHALL NOT*", "*SHOULD*", "*SHOULD NOT*", "*RECOMMENDED*", "*NOT
   RECOMMENDED*", "*MAY*", and "*OPTIONAL*" in this document are to be
   interpreted as described in BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only
   when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.

2.  Introduction

   [RFC8140] refers to the intended move of RFC formatting to XML2RFC v3
   [RFC7990], in the following terms:

   Although the RFC Editor has recently dragged the IETF kicking and
   screaming into the twentieth century [RFC7990] [RFC7996], there is a
   yearning among all right-thinking Internet architects to "keep it
   simple" and to return to the olden days when pigs could be given
   thrust without anyone taking undue offence.

   -- A.  Farrel

Internet-Draft           Hand Grenade of Antioch              April 2018

   While no pigs, flying or otherwise, are involved in the transition to
   RFC XML v3, it is opportune to enhance the [RFC8140] legendarium in
   the service of RFC XML v3, by illustrating its functionality through
   references to the mythology of Camelot, and particularly the
   incidents at the Cave of Caerbannog.

   The screaming move into the twenty-*first* century is accompanied by
   a move back to the late twentieth century, with ASCII stylings more
   wonted in haunts like ftp://ftp.wwa.com/pub/Scarecrow (known to be
   accessible in 1996.)

   There are two references to rabbits in _Monty Python and the Holy
   Grail_ which are expounded on herewith:

   Trojan Rabbit
      In their siege of the French-occupied castle which may already
      contain an instance of the Grail, Sir Bedevere the Wise proposes
      to use a Trojan Rabbit to infiltrate the castle, with a raiding
      party to take the French "not only by surprise, but totally
      unarmed."
      The proposal, unsurprisingly, proved abortive.  The more so as the
      raiding party forgot to hide within the Trojan Rabbit, before the
      French soldiers took the Trojan Rabbit inside the castle.

   Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog
      Guarding the entrance to the Cave of Caerbannog; see Section 4.

3.  The French-occupied castle

   The participants of that renowned exercise in cross-cultural
   communication, to wit the exchange between the _Knights of the Round
   Table_ and the taunting French soldiers serving under *Guy de
   Lombard* are, properly speaking, outside the scope of this
   "menagerie", being more or less human.  Notwithstanding, several^ish^
   beasts both animate_d_ and wooden played a significant part in this
   encounter; most notably:

   o  The Projectile Cow, see Figure 1

   o  The Trojan Rabbit, see Figure 2

        Figure 2: The Trojan Rabbit with an automatic sliding door

   While the exchange at the French-occupied castle is one of the more
   memorable scenes of _Monty Python and the Holy Grail_, the Trojan
   Rabbit has not reached the same level of cultural resonance as its
   more murderous counterpart.  Reasons for this may include:

   o  Less overall screen-time dedicated to the Trojan Rabbit.

   o  The Trojan Rabbit as projectile has already been anticipated by
      the Cow as projectile.

   [CREF1]

   The exchange of projectile animals was the beginning of a long-
   running fruitful relationship between the British and the French

   peoples, which arguably predates the traditional English enmity with
   the French.

4.  The Mythos of Caerbannog

   The _Cave of Caerbannog_ has been well-established in the mythology
   of Camelot (as recounted by Monty Python) as the lair of the
   Legendary Black Beast of Arrrghhh, more commonly known today as the
   *Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog* Section 4.1.  It is the encounter
   between the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog and the Knights of the Round
   Table, armed with the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch (see the following
   section (Section 4.2)), that we recount here through monospace font
   and multiple spaces.

4.1.  The Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog

   The *Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog*, that most formidable foe of the
   Knights and of all that is holy or carrot-like, has been depicted
   diversely in lay and in song.  We venture to say, _contra_ the claim
   made in Section 4.1 of Ze Vompyre [RFC8140], that the Killer Rabbit
   of Caerbannog truly is the most afeared of all the creatures.  Short
   of sanctified ordnance such as Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch, there
   are few remedies known against its awful lapine powers.

   The following depiction (Figure 3) of the fearsome beast has been
   sourced from Rabbit-SCII [1], accompanied (Figure 4) by C code that
   was used in this accurate depiction of the Killer Rabbit:

      Figure 5: The Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch (don't pull the pin)

               Figure 6: The Sovereign's Orb made invisible

   The solution to the impasse at the Cave of Caerbannog was provided by
   the successful deployment of the *Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch* (see
   Figure 5) .  Any similarity between the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch
   and the mythical _Holy Spear of Antioch_ is purely intentional; any

   similarity between the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch and the
   _Sovereign's Orb of the United Kingdom_ (see Figure 6) is putatively
   fortuitous.

   Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch
      Ordnance deployed by Brother Maynard under the incantation of a
      lector, in order to dispense with the Foes of the Virtuous.  See
      Figure 5.

   Holy Spear of Antioch
      A supposed relic of the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, this is one
      of at least four claimed instances of the lance that pierced
      Christ's side.  Its historical significance lies in inspiring
      crusaders to continue their siege of Antioch in 1098.

   Sovereign's Orb of the United Kingdom
      Part of the Crown Jewels of the United Kingdom, the Sovereign's
      Orb is a hollow gold sphere set with jewels and topped with a
      cross.  It was made for Charles II in 1661.  See Figure 6.

   The instructions in the _Book of Armaments_ on the proper deployment
   of the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch *MAY* be summarized as follows,
   although this summary *SHALL NOT* be used as a substitute for a
   reading from the Book of Armaments:

       *  Breakfast Cereals

       *  Fruit Bats

   4.  The Count

       A.  Count is to Three: no more, no less

       B.  Not Four

       C.  Nor Two, except if the count then proceeds to Three

       D.  Five is Right Out

   5.  Lob the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards the Foe

   6.  The Foe, being naughty in the *LORD's* sight, *SHALL* snuff it

   This could also be represented in pseudocode as follows:

   1.  Take out the Holy Pin

   2.  The Count

   integer count;
   for count := 1 step 1 until 3 do
     say(count)
   comment Five is Right Out

   3.  Lob the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards the Foe

   4.  Foe snuffs it

   The following human (more-or-less) protagonists were involved in the
   two incidents recounted as lore of the Knights of the Round Table:

5.1.  Past the Killer Rabbit

   Once the Killer Rabbit of Caerbannog (Figure 3) had been dispatched,
   the Knights of the Round Table uncovered the last words of Joseph of
   Arimathea, inscribed on the Cave of Caerbannog in Aramaic.  While the
   precise Aramaic wording has not survived, we trust the following
   Hebrew subtitles will serve as an acceptable substitute:

   "Here may be found the last words of Joseph of Arimathea.  He who is
   valiant and pure of spirit may find the Holy Grail in the castle of
   -- Aaaargh."

6.  IANA Considerations

   IANA might consider a registry to track the mythical, especially
   ravaging beasts, such as the Killer Rabbit, who haunt the Internet.

7.  Security Considerations

   Do not let the Killer Rabbit out under any circumstance.

   I repeat.  Do not let the Killer Rabbit (Figure 3) out.
