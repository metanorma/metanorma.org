= Setting up Metanorma

The Metanorma command-line toolchain can be installed with any of the following
installation methods suitable for your platform.


== Platform-specific installation

Choose your platform:

* link:/install/macos/[macOS]
* link:/install/windows/[Windows]
* link:/install/linux/[Linux]


== Platform-independent installation

The following installation methods are intended for skilled Metanorma experts
who develop on Metanorma or require automated actions.

* link:/install/docker/[Docker]
+
[TIP]
.Installing via Docker
====
Docker is a platform-independent container engine. The official
https://hub.docker.com/u/metanorma[Metanorma Docker containers on Docker Hub]
provide a simple and consistent to run Metanorma, especially on
continuous integration (CI) environments.
====

* link:/software/metanorma-cli/[Ruby gem]
+
[TIP]
.Development installation
====
Assuming you know what you're doing, the
https://rubygems.org/gems/metanorma-cli[metanorma-cli] gem can be manually
installed for development.

You will have to take care of dependencies: an appropriate Ruby version,
plus other software depending on the end documents you're building.

Refer to the link:/install/develop[Development installation guide]
for details.
====


== Continuous delivery environments

Metanorma is often run on continuous integration (CI) and continuous deployment
(CD) environments.

* link:/install/cicd[GitHub Actions and GitLab CI/CD]


== Running Metanorma

Refer to the following documentation on how to run the `metanorma` command:

* link:/install/man[Metanorma manual] for more details on its command options; and
* link:/install/usage[Using Metanorma] for instructions on how to use Metanorma.
* link:/install/site[Using Metanorma: site] for instructions on how to use Metanorma to generate sites.



== Installing additional flavors

The method to install additional flavors depends on how Metanorma was installed.

* If Metanorma was installed through an installation package, such as from
SnapCraft (Linux),
Homebrew (macOS) or
Chocolatey (Windows),
these packages install the Metanorma single executable (built from `packed-mn`).
They do not support additional flavors.

* If Metanorma was installed as a Ruby gem (from GitHub or
https://rubygems.org[RubyGems.org]), you can add the additional flavor gems
to your Ruby installation with one of these methods:

** Directly install the flavor gem using `gem install metanorma-{flavor}`
+
[TIP]
.Installing a flavor through the `gem install` command
====
The following command installs the Ribose flavor.

[source,sh]
----
gem install metanorma-ribose
----
====

** Install the flavor gem by specifying it in a `Gemfile`, then run the `bundle`
command
+
[TIP]
.Installing a flavor through a Gemfile
====
A `Gemfile` that adds the Ribose flavor:

[source,ruby]
----
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gem 'metanorma-cli'
gem 'metanorma-ribose'
----
====

* If you use Metanorma through Docker, using the official Metanorma Docker
images, additional flavors can be installed using `Gemfile`, and then running
the
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-build-scripts/blob/main/gemfile-to-bundle-add.sh[gemfile-to-bundle-add.sh]
script to add those to the running container.
+
[TIP]
.Installing a flavor to a Metanorma Docker container
====
The `Gemfile` specified above can be used in the Metanorma Docker images for
installing the additional `metanorma-ribose` flavor with the following command
run within the Docker container:

[source,sh]
----
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metanorma/metanorma-build-scripts/main/gemfile-to-bundle-add.sh | bash
----
====
[[installation]]
== Installation

[[macOS]]
=== Using https://brew.sh/[Homebrew]

[source,sh]
----
brew tap metanorma/metanorma
brew install metanorma
----

or

[source,sh]
----
brew install metanorma/metanorma/metanorma
----


[[linux]]
== Linux

[[snap]]
=== Using https://snapcraft.io[Snap]

The easiest way is to install the https://snapcraft.io/metanorma[Metanorma Snap]
with a single command:

[source,sh]
----
sudo snap install metanorma
----

If `snapd` isn't available on your distribution, use the all-in-one install script
described below for various platforms.
You will need to have `curl` installed beforehand.

TIP: For details, please see the https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-linux-setup[metanorma-linux-setup] repository.


=== Install script for Ubuntu

The `curl` command must be installed.

[source,sh]
----
sudo bash -c "curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metanorma/metanorma-linux-setup/master/ubuntu.sh | bash"
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metanorma/metanorma-linux-setup/master/install-gems.sh | bash
----


=== Install script for CentOS

The `curl` command must be installed.

[source,sh]
----
sudo bash -c "curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metanorma/metanorma-linux-setup/master/centos.sh | bash"
curl -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metanorma/metanorma-linux-setup/master/install-gems.sh | bash
----


[[windows]]
== Windows

[[chocolatey]]
=== Using https://chocolatey.org/[Chocolatey]

To install `chocolatey` follow https://chocolatey.org/install[these instructions]

Execute the following in your `cmd.exe` or `PowerShell`
to install the Metanorma Chocolatey package:

[source,console]
----
choco install metanorma -y
----

[TIP]
====
For LaTeX processing, a UTF-8 compatible command line interface is necessary.
If you are using the Windows default command line interpreter `cmd.exe`,
please do run `chcp 65001` before using Metanorma.
====

[TIP]
====
See
link:/blog/12-25-2018/metanorma-on-windows-via-chocolatey/[the blog post on Metanorma Chocolatey package]
for more background.
====


[[docker-setup]]
== Docker setup

This setup method works for all platforms that support the Docker container
framework.

[TIP]
====
This method is the recommended way of getting Metanorma installed.

Possible reasons to _avoid_ this method:

* Performance. Using Metanorma inside Docker container may be a bit slower.

====

. Pull the container:
+
[source,sh]
----
docker pull metanorma/metanorma
----

. Specify the `:local-cache-only:` AsciiDoc attribute
in document header to speed up rendering (optional)

To render the document into HTML, Word and XML,
execute from within the directory containing the Metanorma document
(replacing `{my-document-path}` with your actual document's filename):

.Running the Metanorma container on macOS and Linux
[source,console]
--
docker run -v "$(pwd)":/metanorma/ -w /metanorma metanorma/metanorma metanorma compile -t {flavor} -x {output-formats} {my-document-path}
--

.Running the Metanorma container on Windows
[source,console]
--
docker run -v "%cd%":/metanorma/ -w /metanorma metanorma/metanorma metanorma compile -t {flavor} -x {output-formats} {my-document-path}
--

[TIP]
====
See https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-docker[metanorma-docker] for more information.
