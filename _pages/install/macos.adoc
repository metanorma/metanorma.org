== Install Metanorma via Homebrew

https://brew.sh/[Homebrew] is a popular package manager on macOS.

You will need to first install Homebrew; just run the one-line installation
command given on https://brew.sh/[Homebrew]'s landing page.

Then, run the following commands in Terminal.app:

[source,sh]
----
brew install metanorma/metanorma/metanorma
----

[[macos-install-ruby]]
== Install Ruby

While macOS provides a default installation of Ruby, it is restricted in a number of ways.

We strongly recommend installing a Ruby outside of the system Ruby using `rbenv`.

[source,console]
----
# Install Xcode and associated development tools
$ xcode-select --install

# Install GCC and development tools
$ brew install autoconf gcc make

# Install rbenv to manage Ruby versions
# Remember to follow the setup steps by running `rbenv init`!
$ curl -fsSL https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv-installer/raw/HEAD/bin/rbenv-installer | bash

# Install Ruby 3.1.2 through rbenv [or whatever the latest version is]
$ rbenv install 3.1.2

# Set Ruby 3.1.2 as your global version
$ rbenv global 3.1.2

# Then restart Terminal.app

NOTE: Very large documents may trigger a 'Too many open files" error on MacOS. We recommend you set
`ulimit -n 1024` on your Mac to forestall this.
