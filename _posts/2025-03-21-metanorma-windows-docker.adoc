  Metanorma announces the availability of native Windows Docker containers,
  enabling true Windows-based workflows in Docker and GitHub Actions for standards developers.
---

== Introduction

We are excited to announce the release of native Windows Docker containers for Metanorma!

This new offering extends our cross-platform capabilities by providing true
Windows-native container environments for standards development. These
containers join our existing Linux-based offerings (Debian, Ubuntu, and Alpine)
to create a comprehensive container ecosystem that supports workflows on all
major platforms.

== Why Windows containers?

While Metanorma has always been usable on Windows systems through Linux
containers, native Windows containers offer several unique advantages:

* True Windows environment: Run Metanorma in a genuine Windows Server
environment with native filesystem behavior

* GitHub Actions integration: Use Metanorma in Windows-based GitHub Actions
workflows without compatibility layers

* Enterprise compatibility: Align with Windows-centric enterprise environments
that require native Windows containers

* Performance optimization: Experience potential performance improvements when
running on Windows hosts with matching kernel versions

== Technical details

=== General

The Windows containers are built on Microsoft's official Windows Server Core
container images, optimized for standards development workflows with Metanorma.

=== Container images and tags

The Windows containers are available in multiple variants based on Windows
Server versions:

`metanorma/metanorma:windows-latest`:: Built on the Windows Server 2022
container base of `mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2022`

`metanorma/metanorma:windows-2019-latest`:: Built on the container of
`mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/framework/runtime:4.8`: Windows Server 2019 with .NET
Framework 4.8 which is required for Chocolatey

`metanorma/metanorma:windows-2025-latest`:: Built on the Windows Server 2025
container base of `mcr.microsoft.com/windows/servercore:ltsc2025`

=== What's inside

The Windows containers include:

* Full Metanorma CLI and all standard Metanorma flavors
* Ruby runtime environment
* Git, MSYS2, and MinGW tools
* Inkscape for image processing
* PlantUML for diagram generation
* Fonts and other required dependencies

=== Version compatibility

Please note that Windows containers require kernel version compatibility between
the host and container. This means that the container's Windows version should
match the host's Windows version for optimal performance and compatibility.

For optimal performance and compatibility:

. Windows Server 2022 host should use the 2022-based container
. Windows Server 2019 host should use the 2019-based container
. Windows Server 2025 host should use the 2025-based container

If that is not possible, you can always use the following alternatives:

* use Hyper-V isolation to run containers regardless of the
host's Windows version, though with a slight performance penalty,

* use WSL2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) to run the Metanorma Linux containers
on Windows.

== Usage examples

=== Basic document compilation

To compile a Metanorma document using a Windows container from the Command
Prompt:

[source,sh]
----
docker run -v "%cd%:c:/metanorma" metanorma/metanorma:windows-latest metanorma compile document.adoc
----

From PowerShell:

[source,sh]
----
docker run -v "${PWD}:c:/metanorma" metanorma/metanorma:windows-latest metanorma compile document.adoc
----

=== Using Hyper-V isolation

If you need to run a container version that doesn't match your host Windows
version:

[source,sh]
----
docker run --isolation=hyperv -v "%cd%:c:/metanorma" metanorma/metanorma:windows-latest metanorma compile document.adoc
----

=== Specifying output formats

As with our Linux containers, you can specify multiple output formats:

[source,sh]
----
docker run -v "%cd%:c:/metanorma" metanorma/metanorma:windows-latest metanorma compile -x html,pdf,doc document.adoc
----

== GitHub Actions integration

=== General

One of the most powerful features of these Windows containers is their ability
to integrate with GitHub Actions on Windows runners.

=== Workflow example

Here's a simple example of how to use the Metanorma Windows container in a
GitHub Actions workflow:

[source,yaml]
----
name: Build Documents

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: windows-2022
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Build with Metanorma
        run: |
          docker run -v ${PWD}:c:/metanorma metanorma/metanorma:windows-latest metanorma compile document.adoc
----

This enables organizations with Windows-centric infrastructure to integrate
Metanorma smoothly into their CI/CD pipelines.

== Testing and quality assurance

The Windows containers undergo rigorous testing to ensure they meet Metanorma's
high standards for reliability and performance. Our testing process includes:

* Automated builds across all supported Windows Server versions
* Functional testing of all Metanorma features
* Integration testing with GitHub Actions workflows
* Cross-platform compatibility verification

[example]
====
A typical testing workflow validates that documents can be successfully compiled
with the same output across Linux and Windows containers:

[source,sh]
----
# Compile with Linux container
docker run -v "$PWD":/metanorma metanorma/metanorma metanorma compile document.adoc

# Compile with Windows container
docker run -v "%cd%:c:/metanorma" metanorma/metanorma:windows-latest metanorma compile document.adoc

# Compare outputs
diff _output/document.html _output_windows/document.html
----

== Benefits for standards developers

=== Streamlined Windows workflows

For standards developers working in Windows environments, these containers offer:

* Native Windows command shell integration
* Seamless file system access with proper path handling
* No need to context switch between Windows and Linux environments
* Better performance when running on Windows hosts

=== Enterprise integration

Organizations with Windows-centric IT policies can now:

. Use Metanorma within corporate CI/CD pipelines based on Windows
. Maintain compliance with IT policies that may restrict Linux usage
. Provide standardized development environments across Windows-based teams
. Integrate with other Windows tools and services

=== Simplified deployment

The Windows containers simplify deployment by:

* Eliminating the need for WSL or Linux VMs on Windows hosts
* Reducing setup time with pre-packaged dependencies
* Providing consistent environments across development and production
* Supporting Windows-native CI/CD systems

== Getting started

To get started with Metanorma Windows containers:

. Install Docker Desktop for Windows with Windows container support enabled
. Pull the appropriate container for your Windows version:
+
[source,sh]
----
docker pull metanorma/metanorma:windows-latest
----
+
. Run a test compilation:
+
[source,sh]
----
docker run -v "%cd%:c:/metanorma" metanorma/metanorma:windows-latest metanorma --version
----
+
. Start creating and compiling your standards documents!

== Conclusion

The addition of Windows Docker containers to the Metanorma ecosystem represents
a significant step forward in our mission to provide flexible, platform-agnostic
tools for standards development. Whether you're working in a Windows-centric
enterprise environment, need to integrate with Windows-based CI/CD workflows, or
simply prefer working in Windows, these containers provide a native, optimized
solution.

We invite you to try the new Windows containers and share your feedback with us.
Your input is invaluable as we continue to improve and expand Metanorma's
capabilities.
