  Metanorma is now recruiting an open-source technical writer
  for its GSoD 2021 season!
---

Metanorma has been accepted by
https://developers.google.com/season-of-docs[Google's Season of Docs] 2021!

The Google Summer of Docs (GSoD) program aims to raise awareness
of open source, of docs, and of technical writing.

Similar to the very successful Google Summer of Code (GSoC) program,
GSoD provides support for open source projects to improve their documentation, and gives professional technical writers an opportunity to gain experience in open source.

The current Metanorma GSoD project aims to develop an authoring guide
for new users, and is expected to complete in 3 months time.

We are now recruiting a technical writer, fluent in open source,
to contribute to Metanorma documentation content
as well as structure. Experience in technical writing,
software documentation and in supporting open source projects
would be viewed positively.

The details and budget of the project can be found at our
link:/blog/2021-03-26/metanorma-gsod-2021/[GSoD proposal page].

For those of you interested, you can apply by:

* posting at our GitHub https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma/discussions[Discussions page]; or
* sending your CV to open.source@ribose.com

Looking forward to a great summer!
