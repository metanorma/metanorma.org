excerpt: >-
  Metanorma-generated PDFs contain now reviewer notes and comments annotated
  by Metanorma reviewer comments AsciiDoc markup feature.
---

== Introduction

As you may know you can annotate a Metanorma AsciiDoc document with comments and
'TODO's text: link:/author/topics/reviewing/[Reviewer notes and comments]
Until recently, the Metanorma-generated DOC and HTML only contained reviewer notes.
Now reviewer notes available in the generated PDFs.

== How Metanorma publishes reviewer notes in PDF

Let's take an example from https://github.com/metanorma/mn-samples-iso/blob/main/sources/international-standard/body/body-en.adoc
```
[reviewer=ISO,date=2017-01-01,from=foreword,to=foreword]
****
A Foreword shall appear in each document. The generic text is shown here. It does not contain requirements, recommendations or permissions.

For further information on the Foreword, see *ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2016, Clause 12.*
****
```

It's standalone reviewer note that doesn't relate to concrete text and shows at the end of the section.

The following example demonstrates how this reviewer note renders in a generated PDF document:
* small orange icon with a tool-tip
* comment's text in the Acrobat Reader Comment tool panel

In the second example we add reviewer note for the concrete word in the text:
```
This second edition cancels and replaces the [[start_review1]]second[[end_review1]] edition (ISO {docnumber}-{partnumber}:2009), which has been technically revised.
...

[reviewer=ISO,date=2022-07-01,from=start_review1,to=end_review1]
****
Instead of _second_ should be _first_.
****
```

The following example demonstrates how this 'in-lined' reviewer note renders in a generated PDF document:
* small orange icon with a tool-tip
* highlighted text
* comment's text in the Acrobat Reader Comment tool panel

== How reviewer notes renders in the popular PDF readers

The PDF readers have different support for the reviewer notes ('comments' in terms of PDF) and rich text (bold, italic) in them.
