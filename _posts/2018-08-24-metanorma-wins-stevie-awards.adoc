    This year's judges lauded the development of Metanorma as a
    "revolutionary concept", noting that, "Setting standards for
    standardization is a very important requirement. This is a great
    initiative." Another judge remarked that to anyone who has to
    administrate such standards, Metanorma "will seem like a
    godsend."

The Metanorma project was named winner of two Gold Stevie® Awards
in the http://stevieawards.com/iba[15th Annual International Business Awards®],
for the categories
"`Best New Semantic Technology Platform, Tools and Applications`", and
"`Best New Scholarly Publishing Information Solution`".

Based on the notion that standard documents from different
standards-setting bodies rely on common requirements, Metanorma enables
creation of semantic-aware standard documents in an end-to-end,
author-to-print workflow.

Metanorma consists of three parts:

* a unified document model for standard documents,

* a serialization format for standard documents, and

* a toolchain for authors to directly publish standard documents in the
correct structure and appearance without the need for post-processing.

This year's IBA judges lauded the development of Metanorma as a
"`__revolutionary concept__`", noting that, "`__Setting standards for
standardization is a very important requirement. This is a great
initiative__`". Another judge remarked, "`__To anyone who has to
administrate such standards, this [Metanorma] will seem like a
godsend.__`"

The Metanorma toolchain is already being used by standard authors
worldwide to create standards for international standardization bodies
such as CalConnect and ISO.

In addition, Metanorma also makes it straightforward for any
organization to create their own standard or specification documents in
a best practices manner, by providing fully open-source tools for
semantically accurate authoring of the documents and the flexible
rendering of them.
