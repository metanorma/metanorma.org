  Metanorma-generated PDFs utilize advanced tagging structures provided by the
  ISO 32000:2008 PDF standard to best facilitate usage of assistive
  technologies.

== Need for accessibility tagging

https://www.atia.org/home/at-resources/what-is-at/[Assistive technologies (AT)]
in general and screen readers are important tools for the visually impaired
to read documents, and that also applies to standardization documents prepared
using Metanorma.

Many organizations that utilize the Metanorma suite are legally required
to provide "`accessible`" output, in other words, additional information that
ensures content to be useable by AT tools.

Metanorma is committed to supporting the population that utilize assistive
technologies. In this post we introduce Metanorma PDF accessibility features
that are built into every PDF generated using Metanorma.

NOTE: Common legal requirements include the US Federal Government's
https://www.section508.gov[Section 508] and the
https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1202[European Accessibility Act].


== Introducing the PDF tag tree

Those who have read the previous post about
link:/blog/2021-08-26/pdf-accessibility-for-math-formulas/[PDF math accessibility]
will know that the PDF format provides two kinds of information hierarchies,
namely:

* the content tree is the representation of the layout of content, providing a
  hierarchy of data elements that reflect the selectable text of a PDF file;

* the tag tree is the representation of the logical structure of the document
  and its content, providing a hierarchy of data elements intended for
  accessibility applications.

Accessibility features in PDF commonly rely on information embedded in the tag
tree.

The PDF tag tree is implemented as a hierarchy of tags with metadata that each
relate to a visual element on the page, in effect "tagging" a content
element with additional information.
Each tag defines the structural role of the content element, such as whether it
is a section title, or a list label, etc.

In fact, a correctly populated and structured tag tree is a main requirement for
screen readers and other assistive technologies to work properly with a PDF
document.

Tags are immensely useful for accessibility experiences, they:

* allow the identification of document elements and their roles, such as
  headers, paragraphs, lists, and external elements (outside of the PDF file)
  on a PDF page, in effect making the content accessible;

* provide a meaningful reading order for screen readers, text-to-speech tools
  and other assistive technology tools;

* facilitate document resizing/reflowing for viewing with non-default
  font-size or smaller screens.

NOTE: Specification of PDF tags are defined in the PDF 1.7 standard,
https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf[ISO 32000:2008].


== Basic structural tagging

As described in the previous post,
Metanorma generates PDFs through `mn2pdf`, a Java PDF processor based on the
open-source
http://xmlgraphics.apache.org/fop/[Apache FOP (Formatting Objects Processor)],
a print formatter driven by
https://www.w3.org/TR/xsl/[XSL formatting objects (XSL-FO)] technology.

While Apache FOP provides a default mapping for Formatting Objects (FO) to
PDF tags, the mapping is basic and does not fully meet the needs of modern
assistive technologies.

In the following sections we illustrate how Metanorma performs tagging.

.Metanorma formatting object mapping to PDF tags (identical to Apache FOP)
[cols="a,a,a",options="header"]
|===
| Meaning | Formatting object element | PDF tag value

| Major division, clause/section | `fo:page-sequence`   | `Part`
| Block          | `fo:block-container` | `Div`
| Paragraph      | `fo:block`           | `P`

|===

== Detailed structural tagging

=== Lists and list items

The PDF standard also provides the list and list item tags to identify those
roles within rendered content, in Metanorma we extend the mapping to them.

.List-related mapping to PDF tags
[cols="a,a,a",options="header"]
|===
| Meaning | Formatting object element | PDF tag value

| List      | `fo:list-block` | `L`
| List item | `fo:list-item`  | `LI`

|===

The following example demonstrates the tagged list and list items in a
generated PDF document.

We've customized the mapping to more accuracy of the tagging:

=== Headings, sub-headings and more

The PDF standard provides a series of heading tags to identify the
differentiation of importance amongst headings, and they are automatically
supported by the Metanorma PDF generation engine.

These tags are not mapped from Formatting Objects but directly set by
the generation engine in output.

.Heading mapping to PDF tags
[cols="a,a",options="header"]
|===
| Meaning | PDF tag value

| Header 1, clause heading  | `H1`
| Header 2, sub-clause heading  | `H2`
| Header 3, second-level sub-clause  | `H3`
| Header 4, third-level sub-clause | `H4`
| Header 5, fourth-level sub-clause | `H5`
| Header 6, fifth-level sub-clause | `H6`

|===

=== Table of contents

The PDF standard provides the `TOC` and `TOCI` tags for the "Table of Contents"
section and each individual entry within the table of contents.

.Table of contents mapping to PDF tags
[cols="a,a",options="header"]
|===
| Meaning | PDF tag value

| Table of contents section          | `TOC`
| Table of contents individual entry | `TOCI`

|===

.Tags `TOC` and `TOCI` for the Table of Contents

=== Block quotes

The `BlockQuote` tag is provided by the PDF standard to tag quotations in block
form.

.Block quote mapping to PDF tags
[cols="a,a",options="header"]
|===
| Meaning | PDF tag value

| Block quote | `BlockQuote`

|===

.Tag `BlockQuote` for block quotations
image::/assets/blog/2021-09-03_5.png[Tag `BlockQuote` for block quotations]


=== Index

While not every document contains an index, the PDF standard helpfully provides
a special tag `Index` to indicate a document's index content.

.Index section mapping to PDF tags
[cols="a,a",options="header"]
|===
| Meaning | PDF tag value

| Index section | `Index`
| Index individual entry | `P`

|===

.Tag `Index` for the document's Index
image::/assets/blog/2021-09-03_6.png[Tag `Index` for the document's Index]

=== Source code

The PDF standard provides the `Code` tag to indicate that the tagged content
is software source code.

.Source code mapping to PDF tags
[cols="a,a",options="header"]
|===
| Meaning | PDF tag value

| Source code inline or block | `Code`

|===

.Tag `Code` to indicate source code

== Summary

Metanorma provides excellent support of PDF accessibility features out of the
box, and particularly provides an accurate and fully structured tag tree in
generated PDFs to facilitate usage of assistive technologies.
