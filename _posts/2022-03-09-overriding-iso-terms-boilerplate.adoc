== Summary

Some ISO Technical Committees and Working Groups have additional requirements
how drafts are prepared on top of those from
https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/part2/index.xhtml[ISO DIR 2] and
https://www.iso.org/ISO-house-style.html[ISO House Style].

This post provides a real world example from ISO 8000-114 to demonstrate how to
comply with additional TC and WG requirements.


== ISO draft preparation rules

In ISO, all drafts prepared are required to be conformant to the
https://www.iso.org/sites/directives/current/part2/index.xhtml[ISO/IEC Directives Part 2],
commonly called the "ISO DIR 2".

For a long time, the working rules of the ISO Editorial Program Managers (EPMs,
or previously, "ISO editors") have been a mystery to standards authors. That
changed in 2021 when ISO's editorial team published their internal editorial
style guide publicly under the title of the
https://www.iso.org/ISO-house-style.html[ISO House Style]. This guide provides a
host of information that authors can take note (i.e. fix preemptively) to
prevent ISO EPMs making additional edits to their drafts.

In addition to these two official resources, some Technical Committees (TCs) and
Working Groups (WGs) apply additional requirements on drafts. Some of these
rules may or may not be fully aligned with the official resources.

Since standards authors are required to work within such boundaries, Metanorma
provides mechanisms (read: advanced usage) to comply with these
requirements.

NOTE: Such functionality is considered advanced usage -- please only use them
when you need them!

== Case study: the ISO 8000 series

The ISO 8000 series is the "Data quality" series of standards, published
by https://www.iso.org/committee/54158.html[ISO/TC 184/SC 4/WG 13],
a working group of the most prolific (and the most awarded) ISO technical
committee,
https://www.iso.org/committee/54158.html[ISO/TC 184/SC 4].

In order to manage its suite of over 20 ISO 8000 standards, WG 13 sets
additional requirements on the drafts of the ISO 8000 series.

The requirements are:

. ISO 8000 standards must share a "Common Introduction" prior to a
  document-specific introduction
  (documented in ISO/TC 184/SC 4/WG 13 N 954)

. ISO 8000 standards have to contain a set of mandatory bibliographic references
  (documented in ISO/TC 184/SC 4/WG 13 N 954)

. ISO 8000 standards must share the same vocabulary set published in ISO 8000-2,
  which entails:

.. Additional terms and definitions defined in ISO 8000 standards must be made
  available in the latest edition of ISO 8000-2. This is a separate action
  done by the project leader outside of the document.

.. All drafts must contain this NOTE:	"Prior to publication of this document as
an International Standard, the following terms and definitions will be published
in ISO 8000-2 and removed from this document."

The predefined texts for ISO/TC 184/SC 4 boilerplate content (predefined text)
is available publicly at:

* https://sd.iso.org/bitbucket-pilot/projects/ISOTC184SC4/repos/boilerplate/browse[ISO/TC 184/SC 4 official boilerplate repository]
* https://github.com/metanorma/iso-tc184-sc4-boilerplate[Metanorma ISO/TC 184/SC 4 boilerplate repository (Metanorma format)]

In addition, ISO/TC 184/SC 4 sets additional requirements on its publications
that can be seen here:

* https://metanorma.github.io/iso-tc184-sc4-directives/documents/supplementary-directives/document.html[ISO/TC 184/SC 4 Supplementary Directives]

== Conforming to requirements that are aligned to official requirements

The first two requirements of the ISO 8000 are easily implementable in a
Metanorma document.

The ISO/TC 184/SC 4 Quality Committee has provided a publicly accessible location
for this boilerplate text, and the Metanorma versions of that content is available
at the
https://github.com/metanorma/iso-tc184-sc4-boilerplate[Metanorma ISO/TC 184/SC 4 boilerplate repository].


For the common introduction, all we need to do is to include the text directly
into the "Introduction" section.

NOTE: The ISO 8000 common introduction is found at https://github.com/metanorma/iso-tc184-sc4-boilerplate/blob/main/iso-8000/sections/00-introduction.adoc[`iso-8000/sections/00-introduction.adoc`].

== Introduction

Digital data deliver value by enhancing all aspects of organizational
performance including:

* operational effectiveness and efficiency;
* safety;
* reputation with customers and the wider public;
* compliance with statutory regulations;
* innovation;
* consumer costs, revenues and stock prices.

In addition, many organizations are now addressing these considerations with
reference to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals

The common references are just inserted in any order within the (informative)
bibliography section as follows.

== Conforming to requirements that exception to official requirements

The third requirement requires inclusion of a NOTE in Clause 3 of all drafts for
the ISO 8000 series. In particular, the introductory wording of Clause 3 needs
to look like this:

.Predefined content required for Clause 3 of ISO 8000 deliverables
====
____
*3 Terms and definitions*

For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in
ISO 8000-2:2020 and the following apply.

NOTE:	Prior to publication of this document as an International Standard, the
following terms and definitions will be published in ISO 8000-2 and removed from
this document.

ISO and IEC maintain terminological databases for use in standardization at the
following addresses:

* ISO Online browsing platform: available at
  http://www.iso.org/obp[http://www.iso.org/obp]

* IEC Electropedia: available at
  http://www.electropedia.org[http://www.electropedia.org]
____
====

The insertion of the NOTE is problematic because it is an exception to
requirements stated in ISO DIR 2.

Specifically, 16.5.3 "`Introductory wording`", ISO DIR 2 specifies that there are
only 4 types of introductory wording content for ISO deliverables. There is no
provision for inserting a NOTE within that introductory wording.

Fortunately, Metanorma is flexible enough to provide a mechanism to do this.
Given that ISO DIR 2 gets updated annually, there are quite some legacy ISO
deliverables that are not conformant to the current ISO DIR 2.

Metanorma allows such exception through the
link:/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/#overriding-predefined-text["overriding predefined text" functionality].

This is done by using the `[.boilerplate]` section override as follows.

NOTE: The ISO 8000 common terminology header is found at
https://github.com/metanorma/iso-tc184-sc4-boilerplate/blob/main/iso-8000/sections/03-terms.adoc[`iso-8000/sections/03-terms.adoc`].

== Terms and definitions

[.boilerplate]
=== WG13 intro

For the purposes of this document, the terms and definitions given in
ISO 8000-2:2020 and the following apply.

NOTE:	Prior to publication of this document as an International Standard, the
following terms and definitions will be published in ISO 8000-2 and removed from
this document.

ISO and IEC maintain terminological databases for use in standardization at the
following addresses:

* ISO Online browsing platform: available at
  http://www.iso.org/obp[http://www.iso.org/obp]

* IEC Electropedia: available at
  http://www.electropedia.org[http://www.electropedia.org]

=== (defined terms below...)

----

Notice that the reference to `ISO_8000-2` has to be manually encoded because
the specified override completely overwrites the entire predefined content
generation mechanism to provide full flexibility.

The resulting rendering in <<fig>> satisfies the requirements from WG 13 on
ISO 8000 series drafts.

== Conclusion

While Metanorma by default strictly adheres to SDO requirements such as those in
ISO DIR 2 and ISO House Style, it also provides a corresponding set of features
for legacy compatibility.

The Metanorma team works closely with ISO TCs and WGs to address their specific
needs and requirements.

In the case of ISO/TC 184/SC 4, the Metanorma AsciiDoc versions of
the required boilerplate content are provided at the
https://github.com/metanorma/iso-tc184-sc4-boilerplate[Metanorma ISO/TC 184/SC 4 boilerplate Git repository].

If you run into any enforcement exceptions that require additional handling or
overriding, please do not hesitate to contact us at the
https://github.com/metanorma/discussions/discussions[Discussions page].

Until next time!
