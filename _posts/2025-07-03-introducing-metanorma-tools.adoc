== ISO standards development with Metanorma Tools: Figure submission process

=== The story

I spent a stressful weekend renaming figures for the submission of ISO/FDIS
19135 for ballot. 60 of them. An exaggeration nonetheless, renaming image files
once isn't hard but doing it multiple times felt like a monumental task tracking
filenames of this set of images.

As project leaders for the ISO 19135 project at ISO/TC 211, Reese Plews
(https://github.com/ReesePlews[GitHub link]) of
https://www.plewsconsulting.com[Plews Consulting] and I had to submit the FDIS
package to SIS for ISO/CS processing.

This step included ensuring that the ISO DIS Word file is properly generated and
that the figures were correctly named and ordered according to the
https://www.iso.org/drafting-standards.html[ISO DRG directives].

While Reese kindly provided the order of figures, and I renamed the files for
submission, once a figure moved around, it was all over again. Not good.

[NOTE]
====
Some would ask: why not just name the image files according to their appearance
order in the document? If you did that from the start then this is a non-issue.

My answer is: I prefer naming image files according to their context and
meaning. I also do not want to rename the files multiple times when they are
moved around in the document.

=== The challenge

If you've ever worked on ISO standards development, you know the drill. The
process is methodical, thorough, and absolutely essential for creating
world-class standards.

Yet the process is fraught with repetitive, manual tasks that consume hours of
valuable time that could be better spent on standards development. Or a sip
of coffee. Or a swim in the hot summer sun or a stroll in the park.

And definitely not renaming files. Renaming 60 figures to comply with ISO DRG's
filename rules, in face of a ballot deadline, was definitely not one of the most
favorite ways to spend time.

=== The solution

Good news is that we've had enough of that... here's the **Metanorma Tools**
toolkit that helps you streamline development.


== Introducing Metanorma Tools

Metanorma, thanks to the warm embrace of the community, is now an indispensable
standards development suite for anyone involved in the creation of standards.

With users ranging from ISO/TCs to national standards bodies to industry
consortia, Metanorma has become the go-to solution for streamlining the
standards development process.

As standards authors ourselves, we understand that the key in standards
development is *not just about authoring standards*, but how to spend time more
wisely.

The time sink is in the processes, repetitive manual tasks, administrative
interfacing and communicating. The devil is in *workflow management*.

To better assist our users in streamlining their workflows around authoring
documents in Metanorma, we have decided to start a new initiative: Metanorma
Tools.

Metanorma Tools is precisely a tool designed to support the standards
development workflows, focusing on individual SDO processes, as a command-line
interface. We start off with supporting ISO document workflows.

The goal is to minimize the tedious, error-prone tasks that bog down standards
development, letting you focus on what really matters: creating excellent
standards.

The tool provides two main capabilities that address critical pain points in
the ISO workflow:

. **Automated figure extraction** with ISO DRG-compliant naming
. **Streamlined comment management** with GitHub integration

Today we will explore figure extraction, and streamlined comment management will
follow in a future post.


== Bridging gaps in your ISO workflow

The ISO standards development process follows a well-defined progression through
these multiple stages (optional ones in parentheses).

The stage progression of the most common document types are shown below:

.ISO document stage progressions by document type
[cols="1,3",options="header"]
|===
| Document Type | Stage Progression

| International Standards
| PWI → NP → AWI → WD (→ WDS) → CD (→ CDS) → DIS (→ FDIS) → IS

| Technical Specifications
| PWI → NP → AWI → WD (→ WDS) → CD (→ CDS) → DTR → TR

| Technical Reports
| PWI → NP → AWI → WD (→ WDS) → CD (→ CDS) → DTR → TR

| Publicly Available Specifications
| PWI → NP → AWI → WD (→ WDS) → CD (→ CDS) → DPAS → PAS

| Amendments
| PWI → NP → AWI → WD (→ WDS) → CD (→ CDS) → DAM (→ FDAM) → Amd

| Corrigendum
| PWI → NP → AWI → WD (→ WDS) → CD (→ CDS) → DCOR (→ FDCOR) → Cor
|===

NOTE: Optional stages are shown in parentheses.

Every stage transition (every "→") requires specific deliverables that
involve significant manual work.

Metanorma Tools aims to plug in the proverbial gap at these junctures,
automating the preparation of submission packages and enabling modern
collaborative workflows for comment resolution.




== Figure extraction... magic

=== General

Actually there's no magic. This can all be deterministicly derived from the
output Metanorma XML file.

When a project reaches ballot or review stages, the project leader ("you"...)
need to provide a figure package that complies with ISO DRG guidelines.

The ISO DRG guidelines specify a particular file name pattern for the document,
which means each figure must be renamed to a document-specific string with the
Figure number in the document.

Here's the sample set given by the DRG guidelines:

.File naming examples from ISO DRG Section 3.2
[cols="1,2,3",options="header"]
|===
| Where used | Filename | Description

| Normal figure
| `12345-1_ed1fig1.dwg`
| File for figure 1

| Normal figure
| `12345-1_ed1fig2.dwg`
| File for figure 2

| Normal figure, subfigure
| `12345-1_ed1fig1a.dwg`
| File for figure 1, subfigure a

| Normal figure, subfigure
| `12345-1_ed1fig1b.dwg`
| File for figure 1, subfigure b

| Normal figure, key file
| `12345-1_ed1fig1_key1.dwg`
| File for figure 1, first key file

| Normal figure, key file
| `12345-1_ed1fig1_key2.dwg`
| File for figure 1, second key file

| Table
| `12345-1_ed1figTab1.dwg`
| File for the single figure in Table 1

| Table
| `12345-1_ed1figTab1a.dwg`
| File for the first figure in Table 1

| Table
| `12345-1_ed1figTab1b.dwg`
| File for the second figure in Table 1

| Annex
| `12345-1_ed1figA1.dwg`
| File for the first figure in appendix A

| Annex
| `12345-1_ed1figA2.dwg`
| File for the second figure in appendix A

| Annex
| `12345-1_ed1figA1a.dwg`
| File for first figure in appendix A, subfigure a

| Annex
| `12345-1_ed1figA1b.dwg`
| File for first figure in appendix A, subfigure b

| Language
| `12345-1_ed1fig1_f.dwg`
| File for figure 1, French translation

| Amendment
| `12345-1_ed1amd1fig1.dwg`
| File for figure 1 of amendment 1

| Inline
| `12345-1_ed1figText1.dwg`
| File for graphical element inline with text

| Special Layout
| `SL12345-1_ed1figTab1.dwg`
| File for table 1 which does not have a figure
|===


The pattern looks simple but it is not entirely straightforward.

There are several factors to consider, such as:

* figure numbers (1, 2, 3 or A.1, B.2, C.3...)
* subfigure numbers ("a)", "b)", etc.)
* key files (if you use images in a figure/table key)


=== The manual way (before)

Assume that your image files are named according to what they mean, instead of
the order of appearance in the document.

. Know the figure number (1, 2, 3,... A.1, B.2, C.3...)
. Create a map between the image filenames and the figure number.
. Rename each file following the ISO DRG pattern
. Create a ZIP package of these images
. Hope you didn't make any typos...


=== The Metanorma Tools way (now)

[source,bash]
----
$ metanorma-tools extract-images <document.presentation.xml> --zip
----

Where,

`document.presentation.xml`:: is the Metanorma Presentation XML file generated
by Metanorma.


That's it. A single command extracts all figures, applies ISO DRG-compliant
naming automatically, and creates a submission-ready ZIP package.

[source]
----
$ metanorma-tools extract-images 19135_fdis_ed2.presentation.xml --zip

# Output directory structure:
├── 19135_fdis_ed2.zip
└── 19135_fdis_ed2/            # after extracting
    ├── 19135_fdis_ed2fig1.svg
    ├── 19135_fdis_ed2fig2.png
    ├── 19135_fdis_ed2fig3.jpg
    ├── ...
    ├── 19135_fdis_ed2figA1.svg
    └── 19135_fdis_ed2figE1.svg
----

The tool automatically:

* Extracts document metadata (number, stage, edition) from the document
* Generates compliant filenames
* Preserves original image formats
* Creates organized directory structures
* Packages everything for submission
