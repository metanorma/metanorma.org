  Editor notes, reviewer notes and to-dos are now available across Metanorma
  output formats, now including PDF.

== Introduction

Consensus building is vital to any standards development process. For
international or industry standards, the internal circulation and public review
stages are key to demonstrate consensus and gain public acceptance.

During these review stages, reviewers are asked to provide feedback on the
standard draft. Instead of providing a plain draft, standard bodies, authors and
editors may opt to provide additional information inline to the draft being
reviewed, including review notes, guidance and annotations to clarify the intent
of content.

== Supporting annotations in Metanorma

Metanorma supports a host of annotation mechanisms, including:

* Editor notes: notes from the editor (or the editorial process) intended for
the reader

* Reviewer notes: notes and comments from reviewers, internal or external,
intended to highlight or clarify issues. Reviewer comments can apply in two
ways:

** Standalone comments: where the comments apply to a particular point in the
text.

** Ranged comments: where comments apply to a range of text, with a defined
start and end.

* To-dos (also "TODOs"): notes intended for the project's authors or editors as
a reminder for a pending action in content.

Until recently, Metanorma only supported outputting annotations in
HTML and Word DOC formats.

To better support standards bodies and committees that use Metanorma for
standards development, annotation output is now available in
Metanorma-generated PDFs.


[[editors-note]]
== Editor's notes

Editor's notes are specified using the `EDITOR:` prefix or the `[EDITOR]` block
syntax.

The editor's note is rendered as a document element (an admonition), which means
that they are rendered as real elements in the content flow, and cannot span or
point to content. No locality needs to be provided.

The editor's note is always rendered, regardless of the draft status of the
standard.

[[todos]]
== To-dos

To-dos (or "TODOs" in the computer world) are specified using the `TODO:`
prefix or the `[TODO]` block.

Similar to the editor's notes, they are rendered as document elements (as
admonitions) and are presented in the content flow. Again, no locality needs
to be supplied to use to-dos.

Different from the editor's note, to-do blocks are only rendered if the
standard specifies the document attribute `:draft:`.

== Reviewer notes

=== General

Reviewer notes are specified using the `[reviewer]` block syntax.
There are two types of reviewer notes:

* standalone comment
* ranged comment

The reviewer notes (as with the TODOs) are only rendered if the `:draft:`
document attribute is set, which identifies the document as a draft.

We will be using the ISO Rice document
(https://github.com/metanorma/mn-samples-iso/blob/main/sources/international-standard/body/body-en.adoc[Metanorma sample]) as an example.


[[standalone]]
=== Standalone reviewer note

==== Syntax

For a standalone comment, the syntax is as follows:

[source,adoc]
----
[reviewer={name of reviewer},date={YYYY-MM-DD}]
****
Note content
****
----

or

[source,adoc]
----
[reviewer={name of reviewer},date={YYYY-MM-DD},from={anchor}]
****
Note content
****
----

Where:

* `{name of reviewer}` is the name of the reviewer
* `{YYYY-MM-DD}` is the date of the review comment, in the ISO 8601-1 format "YYYY-MM-DD"
* `Note content` is the intended content of the note.
* `{anchor}` (optional) is an anchor location of where the reviewer note should
appear. This parameter is entirely optional.

==== Rendering

A standalone reviewer note is rendered in a generated PDF document with:

* small orange icon with a tool-tip
* comment text in the Acrobat Reader Comment tool panel


==== Example

The following block specifies is a standalone reviewer note -- as it does not
reference a location that relates to concrete text. It is shown at the end of
the specified section of `from` and `to`.


[example]
.Example of a standalone review note (from the ISO Rice document)
====
[source,adoc]
----
[reviewer=ISO,date=2017-01-01,from=foreword]
****
A Foreword shall appear in each document. The generic text is shown here. It
does not contain requirements, recommendations or permissions.

For further information on the Foreword, see
*ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2016, Clause 12*.
****
----

renders as:

.Standalone reviewer note from the ISO Rice document (Adobe Reader)
image::/assets/blog/2022-08-21_standalone.png[Standalone reviewer note from the ISO Rice document (Adobe Reader)]
====

NOTE: This example applies bolding to the "ISO/IEC ..., Clause 12" text. Usage
of rich-text comments are not supported by all PDF readers, please refer to
<<compat>> for details.


[[ranged]]
=== Ranged reviewer note

==== Syntax

For a ranged reviewer note, the syntax is as follows

[source,adoc]
----
[reviewer={name of reviewer},date={YYYY-MM-DD},from={from anchor},to={to anchor}]
****
Note content
****
----

Where:

* `{name of reviewer}` is the name of the reviewer
* `{YYYY-MM-DD}` is the date of the review comment, in the ISO 8601-1 format "YYYY-MM-DD"
* `Note content` is the intended content of the note.
* `{from anchor}` is an anchor location of where the reviewer note should
start.
* `{to anchor}` is an anchor location of where the reviewer note should
end.


==== Rendering

The ranged reviewer note renders as following:

* small orange icon with a tool-tip
* highlighted text
* comment's text in the Acrobat Reader Comment tool panel


==== Example

The following example applies a reviewer note that highlights a textual range,
namely, the text wrapped by the `\[[start_review1]]` and `\[[end_review1]]`
anchors. The reviewer note specifies `from=start_review1,to=end_review1`
as the start and end.

[example]
.Example of a ranged reviewer comment (from the ISO Rice document)
====
[source,adoc]
----
This second edition cancels and replaces the
[[start_review1]]second[[end_review1]] edition (ISO
{docnumber}-{partnumber}:2009), which has been technically revised.
...

[reviewer=ISO,date=2022-07-01,from=start_review1,to=end_review1]
****
Instead of _second_ should be _first_.
****
----

renders as:

.Ranged reviewer note from the ISO Rice document (Adobe Reader)
image::/assets/blog/2022-08-21_ranged.png[Ranged reviewer note from the ISO Rice document (Adobe Reader)]
====

NOTE: This example applies italics to the "second" and "first" texts. Usage
of rich-text comments are not supported by all PDF readers, please refer to
<<compat>> for details.


== Comparison of annotation methods

Here's a handy table that compares the differences between the annotation types.

.Comparison of annotation methods
[cols="2,2,1"]
|===
| Annotation type | When rendered | Supports range?

| <<editors-note>> | Always                           | No
| <<todos>>        | Only when `:draft:` is specified | No
| <<standalone>>   | Only when `:draft:` is specified | No
| <<ranged>>       | Only when `:draft:` is specified | Yes

|===


[[compat]]
== Reader compatibility

While the PDF standard is widely adopted, not all PDF readers implement all the
features available. As it is to be expected, only Adobe Reader (and Adobe Acrobat Pro)
attempts to implement all available features.

In the department of PDF annotations:

* most of the common PDF readers implement plain text comments only
* the presentation of comments vary widely, and can occasionally crash documents
or trigger editing of the comments, and is not always saveable (Preview).

When using reviewer notes, you need to be aware that rich-text functionality
such as bold and italics within the notes will lead to those notes being hidden
(or broken) in PDF readers that do not implement them.

The following table describes the level of annotation support of common PDF
readers.

.Compatibility of PDF comments across popular PDF readers
|===
| PDF viewer application | Comments support | Rich text support

| Adobe Reader      | ✅ | ✅
| Foxit PDF Reader  | ✅ | doesn't display rich text from the generated PDF, but text can be formatted as rich text
| Preview (macOS)   | ✅ | ❌, text displays as plain text only
| Skim (macOS)      | ✅ | ❌, text displays as plain text only
| Firefox (browser) | ✅ | doesn't display bolded text, only italic
| Safari (browser)  | shows only orange icon | doesn't display text at all
| Microsoft Word    | ❌ | ❌
|===


== Conclusion

Metanorma provides multiple methods for semantically annotating standards,
and now this functionality is available across all output formats, including
HTML, Word, and PDF.

When using rich-text annotations, consider the PDF reader compatibility
matrix in <<compat>> for the intended audience.
