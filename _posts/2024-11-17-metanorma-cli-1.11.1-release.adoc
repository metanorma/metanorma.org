We are pleased to announce the release of Metanorma CLI version 1.11.1, a targeted hotfix that addresses version reporting to exclude deprecated Metanorma flavors from system information output.

=== Version reporting improvements

==== Refined version information output

The primary focus of this hotfix is to ensure that the `metanorma version` command provides more accurate and relevant information:

* Deprecated Metanorma flavors are no longer included in version reporting
* This provides a cleaner and more focused view of active components
* It reduces confusion by showing only currently maintained flavors
* It simplifies troubleshooting by emphasizing relevant version information

This change helps users and support teams identify the versions of actively maintained components more easily, streamlining deployment and troubleshooting processes.

=== Continuing improvements

This hotfix release comes shortly after the significant 1.11.0 update, which introduced major architectural enhancements to Presentation XML and numerous document structure improvements. The 1.11.1 release maintains all these capabilities while refining the version reporting system.

As noted in the announcement for this release, development continues with major refactoring of Presentation XML to annotate captions and autonumbering for renderers. These enhancements will be included in upcoming releases.

=== Conclusion

Metanorma CLI 1.11.1 provides a focused improvement to version reporting, ensuring that system information is more relevant and easier to interpret. This hotfix supports effective system maintenance and troubleshooting while preserving all the significant enhancements introduced in version 1.11.0.
