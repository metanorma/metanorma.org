In link:/blog/2022-03-13-iso-house-style.adoc/[Validating against ISO House Style],
we noted that Metanorma-ISO now validates ISO documents against the ISO House Style,
issuing various warnings for wording and punctuation to ensure compliance against
that style guide.

The implementation of ISO House Style validation has now been updated to the 2023
version of the style guide. The following rules have been added:

* https://www.iso.org/ISO-house-style.html#iso-hs-s-text-r-s-need[Need to],
https://www.iso.org/ISO-house-style.html#iso-hs-s-text-r-s-might[might & could]:
Warn of ambiguous provision wording.
* https://www.iso.org/ISO-house-style.html#iso-hs-s-text-r-s-quantity[Quantities and units]:
Warn of more than one level of nesting of subscripts.
* https://www.iso.org/ISO-house-style.html#iso-hs-s-text-r-r-ref_unnumbered[Cross-references to an unnumbered document]:
Superscript cross-references must follow punctuation.
