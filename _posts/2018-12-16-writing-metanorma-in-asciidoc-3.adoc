    AsciiDoc documents are text; so if you already have a document
    in a PDF file, or a Word file, or an HTML file, the simplest
    thing to do is to copy its text into a text document, and then to
    mark it up.

== Marking up sections

We have already seen headings used inside a document to mark up sections. Standards
documents have an expected structure of sections, and these need to be marked up
rigorously in order for a document to comply. This means that you will need to go back
over the headings you have marked up, and add further information to make them the
right kind of section; either by adding style attributes, or by ensuring the heading
wording complies with what is expected.

* The _Foreword_ of a document is taken to be all text between the document header and
the first heading of the document. You can optionally use a caption like `.Foreword`
instead of a heading, but the title to the foreword will be given automatically anyway.

--
[[foreword]]
.Foreword
ISO (the International Organization for Standardization)...
--

* The _Abstract_ of a document is any section with the style attribute of `[abstract]`,
regardless of what its actual title is. The abstract may not be rendered in some
flavors of Metanorma (like ISO), although it will still be added to document metadata
in the XML file (the `bibdata` element). In flavors where it is rendered, it may
appear on the title page (e.g. UN documents), or before the Foreword.

[abstract]
== Summary

ISO (the International Organization for Standardization)...
--

* The _Introduction_ of a document is any section with the heading `Introduction`,
or (as more advanced markup) with an attribute `heading=introduction`. (The
`heading=` attribute can be used for all sections whose headings are meant to
give their particular type.)

[source,asciidoc]
--
[heading=introduction]
== Enkonduko

ISO (la Internacia Organizafo por Normigo)...
--

* The abstract, foreword and introduction together count as the preliminary
material in a Metanorma document: they appear before the main text of the
document, and in Word they are paginated with Roman rather than Arabic numerals.


* Bibliographies, as we have seen, must have the `[bibliography]` style attribute.
A document may have more than one bibliography, with different titles;
ISO for example expects to see _Normative References_ as the second clause of the
document body, and _Bibliography_ as the final clause.

* _Terms and Definitions_ and _Symbols and Abbreviations_ are indicated by
using that text in the heading, or in the `heading=` attribute. (The two sections
can be merged together, as _Terms, Definitions, Symbols and Abbreviations_;
in that case _Symbols and Abbreviations_ is expected to be a distinct sub-clause.)
Both these section types have particular markup requirements: the contents of
 _Symbols and Abbreviations_ are one long definition list (which we'll come to),
while _Terms and Definitions_ treats each term as a separate sub-clause, with its
internal structure rigorously formatted.

== Marking uo blocks

You have gone over all the sections in the document, refined their markup,
and tested with Metanorma rendering to make sure that the sections, at least,
make sense. The next step is to go back over and mark up all blocks.

The following are the types of block supported in Metanorma:

* Unordered lists, which are bulleted, and can be nested. (The style of bullet varies by flavor.)

[source,asciidoc]
--
The main changes compared to the previous edition are:

* updated normative references;
* deletions:
** deletion of 4.3. [nested list item]
** deletion of 4.4. [nested list item]
--

* Ordered lists, which can be nested. The label of each list item is normally set
by the Metanorma flavor; this is so that ordered list items can be referenced consistently.

[source,asciidoc]
--
. the sampling method used;
. the test method used;
. the test result(s) obtained
.. or, if the repeatability has been checked, the final quoted result obtained; [nested list item]
--

* Definition lists.

[source,asciidoc]
--
stem:[w]:: is the mass fraction of grains with a particular defect in the test sample;
stem:[m_D]:: is the mass, in grams, of grains with that defect;
stem:[m_S]:: is the mass, in grams, of the test sample.
--

* Tables.

_____
This International Standard gives the minimum specifications for rice (_Oryza sativa_ L.) which is subject to international trade. It is applicable to the following types: husked rice and milled rice, parboiled or not, intended for direct human consumption. It is neither applicable to other products derived from rice, nor to waxy rice (glutinous rice).

Go back over the document and insert markup for each block that isn't a simple paragraph.
The details of how each different block type works in Metanorma AsciiDoc are
given in the http://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[Asciidoctor user manual]
(as we do not tire from telling), and any Metanorma extensions and
adjustments are documented in the Metanorma documentation:

* link:/author/iso/topics/markup/[Metanorma ISO syntax reference]
* link:/author/topics/asciidoc/[Guidance for Authoring]
* https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc[The Standoc gem Readme] (which gives
the document attributes and markup customizations common to all of Metanorma)
* The Github page for the gem specific to your Metanorma flavor; e.g.
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso, https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-cc

== Marking up inline

The final stage of refining AsciiDoc markup is to focus on inline markup,
within the bounds of the block. We have already seen formatting marks such as
bold, italics, and monospace.

We have also seen the use of anchors, as an
entity to be cross-referenced (`\[[anchor]]`, on its own line),
and of internal cross-references, which
reference an anchor (`\<<anchor>>`); the text of both is generated automatically, and
is auto-numbered. Anything that can be considered a cross-reference
should be, so that the numbering of those references can be handled
automatically; you will need to sweep through the document, to identify
all such instances.

URLs are handled by a macro, consisting of a recognizable URL, followed optionally
(without space) by square brackets containing the text to be hyperlinked;
e.g.:
[source,asciidoc]
----
http://www.iso.org/[International Organization for Standardization].
----

Footnotes are also a macro, consisting of the text `footnote:[]`, with the text
of the footnote contained within the brackets. Metanorma AsciiDoc does not permit footnotes
spanning more than one paragraph, so the contents of the footnote are expected to be a
single line contained within the brackets. The footnote macro is also expected
to be preceded by punctuation, although it is recognized as is, and can also be delimited
by a preceding `\{blank}` (which in Asciidoctor AsciiDoc is simply empty text; blank headers
are also indicated by equals signs followed by `\{blank}`).

Mathematical formatting, finally, is called STEM formatting in Metanorma AsciiDoc, and
are entered using http://asciimath.org[AsciiMath]. Mathematical formatting can be
either a block (which constitutes a formula for standards documents), or inline:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[formulaA-1,A.1]]
[stem]
++++
w = (m_D) / (m_s)  (block)
++++

stem:[w = (m_D) / (m_s)] (inline)
--

In either case, the document attribute `:stem:` must be present in the document
header, for such AsciiMath expressions to be recognized at all. The input AsciiMath
will be converted to MathML and Open Office XML (for Word) downstream.

That is enough to get you started with marking up Metanorma AsciiDoc.
You're best placed to build up from simple structures to more complex, reading
the available documentation, and looking at other existing samples of Metanorma;
all Metanorma gems include sample documents, as well as snippets of Metanorma
AsciiDoc used in internal tests (under the `spec/asciidoctor` directory of each
gem.)

And if you get stuck, you can also ask your friendly neighborhood wizard,
care of info@ribose.com, or by raising an issue on GitHub on the repository of your
Metanorma flavor's gem.
