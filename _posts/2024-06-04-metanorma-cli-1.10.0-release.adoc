== Metanorma CLI 1.10.0: Enhanced navigation and attachment features

We are pleased to announce the release of Metanorma CLI version 1.10.0, a milestone update to our standards authoring software stack. This version introduces several significant user experience enhancements that make standards documents more interactive and easier to navigate, particularly in HTML output formats.

=== General improvements

==== Interactive clause navigation with hover-over highlighting

The standout feature in this release is the introduction of hover-over highlighting and hyperlinks for clause headings in HTML output. This interactive enhancement transforms static document headings into dynamic navigation elements that:

* Provide immediate visual feedback when a user hovers over a section heading
* Make it instantly clear which elements are clickable and can be linked to
* Improve accessibility for users navigating complex technical documents
* Create a more modern, web-native reading experience

This feature is particularly valuable for complex standards documents where precise navigation between interconnected sections is essential for understanding requirements and specifications. The visual highlighting helps readers maintain context while moving through the document, reducing the cognitive load associated with navigating technical content.

==== Document attachments with automated linking

Metanorma now supports document attachments with hyperlinks automatically generated in output formats. This powerful feature enables standards authors to:

* Include supplementary files such as code samples, test suites, or reference implementations
* Provide downloadable templates, worksheets, or tools that support implementation
* Package machine-readable data alongside human-readable documentation
* Create more comprehensive, multi-format documentation sets

In an era where standards increasingly bridge the gap between human-oriented documentation and machine-implementable specifications, this attachment functionality addresses the growing need for standards to exist in multiple complementary formats. Hyperlinks to attachments are clearly presented in the document, making related resources immediately discoverable.

==== Improved error handling for command-line operations

We've enhanced the CLI's error reporting by raising an error flag on exit when illegal options are provided. This seemingly small change has significant benefits for:

* Automated build systems and continuous integration pipelines
* Scripted document generation workflows
* Quality assurance processes that depend on clear success/failure signals
* Developers integrating Metanorma into larger toolchains

By providing unambiguous error signals, this improvement makes Metanorma more reliable and easier to integrate into sophisticated document production environments.

=== Specialized enhancements

==== Requirement reference improvements

If no anchor is specified for a requirement under Modspec, Metanorma now generates an anchor automatically based on the requirement identifier. This enhancement ensures that:

* All requirements are referenceable, even without manual anchor definition
* Cross-reference integrity is maintained throughout the document lifecycle
* Authors can focus on content rather than technical linking details
* Requirement traceability is more comprehensive and reliable

For standards that contain numerous technical requirements, this automatic anchor generation significantly reduces the maintenance burden while improving document quality.

==== Collection manifest refinements

Building on our previous releases' focus on document collections, this version includes several improvements to collection manifests:

* Simplified and streamlined manifest structure for easier maintenance
* Support for processing files outside the current working directory
* Nested collection manifest capability for hierarchical organization
* External script hooks for customizing file processing
* Enhanced object mapping for more structured handling of collection definitions

These refinements make complex document collections more manageable and flexible, supporting the needs of standards organizations that publish families of related specifications.

==== Collection XML namespace handling

We've temporarily modified namespace handling in Collection XML processing while we work on enhancing our external object mapper (Shale) to better handle namespaces. This interim solution prevents potential processing issues while we develop a more comprehensive approach to namespace management in collections.

=== Format-specific improvements

==== ISO documents

For users working with ISO standards, we've removed the display of "Warning for WDs and CDs" notices in DIS and FDIS documents. This targeted improvement ensures that warning messages are context-appropriate, reducing unnecessary notifications in document types where such warnings are not relevant.

==== ITU contributions

Support for justification annexes has been added for ITU contributions, ensuring compliance with ITU's specific document formatting requirements. This specialized feature ensures that justification material appears correctly positioned and formatted within ITU standards.

==== OGC documents

For Open Geospatial Consortium standards, we've added hover-over links for requirement headings as well as clause headings. This enhancement improves navigation in OGC documents that often contain numerous technical requirements, making it easier to locate and reference specific requirements.

==== Plateau document support

Continuing our commitment to support specialized document types, this release maintains compatibility with Plateau documents, ensuring Metanorma remains a comprehensive solution for diverse standards development needs.

=== Conclusion

Metanorma CLI 1.10.0 represents a significant step forward in making standards documents more interactive, navigable, and comprehensive. The introduction of hover-over highlighting, attachment support, and improved error handling reflects our ongoing commitment to enhancing both the authoring experience and the final document quality.
