  Metanorma now provides persistent error logs for detailed debugging
  post-compilation. This post explains how to navigate and utilize these logs
  effectively.
---

== Introduction

Metanorma users often encounter numerous error messages in the console log
during document compilation. These messages are sometimes overwhelming, but are
important for maintaining document quality.

Recently, Metanorma has improved its error logging by saving these logs to disk,
including grammar errors, allowing them to persist for detailed debugging
post-compilation.

This post explains how to navigate and utilize these error logs effectively.

Further details on how to use error logs can be found in the
link:/author/topics/output/validation/[Validation] documentation.

== Error severity levels

Metanorma categorizes errors into four severity levels:

Severity 0:: Fatal errors that prevent document compilation.

Severity 1:: Critical errors that should be addressed.

Severity 2:: Warnings that can often be ignored.

Severity 3:: Informational messages.

TIP: Severity 0 errors, such as duplicate anchors or malformed index markup,
must be resolved for successful document compilation.

== Error categories

Errors are grouped into categories to streamline the troubleshooting process.

The main categories include the following.

`Style`::
Potential violations of the standard-defining organization's (SDO) house style.

`Metanorma XML Syntax`::
Strict XML syntax checks, usually Severity 2.

`Relaton`::
Issues with references from the Relaton bibliographic database.

`Metanorma Markup`::
Various issues such as:

`Anchors`:::
Issues related to the use of anchors within the document, such as duplicate or missing anchors.

`AsciiDoc` Input:::
Errors originating from the AsciiDoc source input, including syntax errors and invalid constructs.

`Bibliography` Syntax:::
Problems with the bibliography section, such as incorrect citation formats or missing references.

`Cross-references`:::
Errors in cross-referencing within the document, including broken links or incorrect reference targets.

`Document Attributes`:::
Issues with document attributes, such as missing or incorrectly defined attributes.

`Images`:::
Problems related to image inclusion, such as missing image files or incorrect image paths.

`Include`:::
Errors with included files, such as missing files or incorrect paths.

`Maths`:::
Issues with mathematical expressions, including syntax errors in math markup.

`Requirements`:::
Problems related to requirements sections, such as missing or incorrectly formatted requirements.

`Table`:::
Errors in table formatting, including incorrect table syntax or missing table elements.

`Terms`:::
Issues with the terms section, such as missing definitions or incorrect term formatting.


== Filtering errors

=== General

Metanorma provides two mechanisms to filter errors in the logs, making it easier
to focus on the most critical issues.

=== Filtering by severity

The first mechanism is filtering by severity. By setting the
`:log-filter-severity:` attribute, users can exclude errors below a certain
severity level. This allows users to concentrate on more severe issues that
require immediate attention.

.Filtering by severity
[example]
====
The following configuration as a document attribute will omit Severity 2 and 3
errors from the log.

[source,asciidoc]
----
:log-filter-severity: 2
----
====

=== Filtering by category

The second mechanism is filtering by error category. This is done using the
`:log-filter-category:` attribute, where users can specify a comma-separated
list of categories to exclude from the log.

Excluding errors from specified categories helps users to streamline the
troubleshooting process by focusing on relevant error types.

.Filtering by category
[example]
====
The following configuration as a document attribute will omit errors from the
"Cross-references", "Document Attributes", and "Metanorma XML Syntax" categories.

[source,asciidoc]
----
:log-filter-category: Cross-references,Document Attributes,Metanorma XML Syntax
----
====


== Error log format

The error log for a document `{document-name}.adoc` is saved as
`{document-name}.err.html` and can be viewed in any browser.

The log starts with a summary of error classes and their counts by severity.

.`{document-name}.err.html` HTML presentation of errors
[example]
____
*Style*: Severity 2: **9** errors

*Metanorma XML Syntax*: Severity 2: **7** errors
____

Each error class links to detailed listings, allowing quick navigation.

Errors are styled by severity for easy identification:

Severity 0:: Boldface on a pink background
Severity 1:: Boldface
Severity 2:: Normal type
Severity 3:: Italicized and grey


== Error details

Each error is presented in a table with the following columns:


Line::
The line number in the source AsciiDoc where the issue occurred.

ID::
The identifier of the location, which could be a clause number, GUID, anchor, or line number in the Metanorma XML file. Hyperlinks are provided for anchors.

Message::
A description of the error.

Context::
Two lines of surrounding Metanorma XML to help locate the error.

The output looks like this.

== Conclusion

The Metanorma error logs now provide detailed and comprehensive information
about each issue, including the severity level, error category, and specific
line numbers in the source document. This allows users to pinpoint the exact
location of errors and understand their context.

By leveraging these logs, users can efficiently identify and resolve issues,
ensuring high-quality content that adhering to the required standards and
guidelines.
