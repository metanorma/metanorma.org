  Metanorma-generated PDFs now support attachments, offering a more robust
  method for bundling related documents and resources.
---
== Introduction

Metanorma now supports PDF attachments, allowing you to embed additional
resources directly within a PDF document generated by Metanorma.

Standards today are increasingly rely on the digital realm, from atmospheric
standards to metrology standards, all define software behavior or information
models, leading to the incorporating machine-readable components as either part
of the standard, as reference implementation, as machine-executable tests or
simply as examples.

Previously, these components were either distributed as separate files or
incorporated as plain text inside a textual document, both methods with
significant drawbacks in terms of version control, readability, consistency, and
interoperability.

Metanorma provides a solution to this problem by supporting attachments,
covering both HTML and PDF outputs.

This article focuses on how to use PDF attachments, which allows you to embed
additional resources directly within a PDF document generated by Metanorma.

NOTE: The PDF attachments feature is available *from* Metanorma v1.10.0.


== Electronic attachments to standards

Standards that specify information models, software behavior, or data exchange
formats often require additional resources to support their implementation and
understanding. These resources can include reference implementations, test
code and data samples.

Here are some notable standards that provide digital artifacts for these
purposes:

* OGC GML has reference tests provided by the
https://github.com/opengeospatial/ets-gml32[OGC Executable Test Suite for GML 3.2].

* ITU-T H.265 provides a number of video files in its conformance test data
(https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-H.265.1/en[ITU-T H.265.1]) and reference software
(https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-H.265.2/en[ITU-T H.265.2]).

* The ISO 10303 series provides STEP EXPRESS schema files as "electronic inserts".


== A unified deliverable with attachments

Metanorma supports attachments in both HTML and PDF outputs. This has the
benefit of providing a unified deliverable that includes all the necessary
resources in one package.

* Simplifies version control and distribution by ensuring all relevant materials are
included together.

* Preserves context by bundling attachments with the main document, reducing
the risk of misinterpretation or misuse.

* Allows offline access, as all attachments are included in the document and
can be accessed without an internet connection.


== Types of attachments to include in a standard

These are good reasons why a standard or specification chooses to provide
electronic attachments:

Reference implementations::
A reference implementation helps developers understand how to implement the
standard correctly. This is particularly useful for standards that describe
complex behavior and require detailed technical specifications for correctly
implementing the standard, such as cryptographic algorithms. For example, the
NIST FIPS 140-2 standard provides reference implementations for cryptographic
algorithms.

Compliance tests::
Providing compliance tests as electronic attachments allows implementers to
verify that their implementations conform to the standard. This is particularly
useful

Example files::
Example files can help users understand the expected data structures and formats
described in the standard. For example, the OGC GML standard provides example
snippets in the standard that illustrate the expected data structures and
formats.

Machine-readable files::
Standards that describe data exchange formats often feature machine-readable
snippets in the document for illustration. These snippets are better provided
as actual files than requiring the reader to copy and paste them for testing.



== PDF attachments

=== General

Not many people know that PDFs can contain attachments!

This feature was first introduced in PDF version 1.3, released in 1999. Today,
the only PDF reader that consistently supports this feature is Adobe Reader.

Some other PDF readers and creators do support PDF attachments, but the level of
support and the user interface for accessing attachments can vary between
different PDF readers.

Most system default PDF readers, such as Preview on macOS, do not support PDF
attachments.

Metanorma as part of its
link:blog/2021-08-26-pdf-accessibility-for-math-formulas/["accessible math" effort],
has implemented PDF attachments for making MathML snippets available for
download, and has extended this feature for all types of attachments.


=== Reader support (or lack thereof)

Not all PDF readers support PDF attachments. This is the current list of
attachment support in common PDF readers.

|===
| Support | Platform | Application

| ✅ | Windows | Adobe Reader

| ❌ | macOS | Preview
| ❌ | macOS | Skim
| ❌ | Cross-platform | Firefox (built-in PDF viewer)
| ❌ | Cross-platform | Chrome (built-in PDF viewer)

NOTE: When distributing PDFs with attachments, it is advisable to inform readers
about the presence of attachments and recommend using a compatible PDF reader.


== Considerations of delivering attachments in PDF

These are some considerations to be think about when providing attachments in PDF.

File size::
Attachments can significantly increase the overall size of the PDF, potentially
making it more challenging to share or download.

Compatibility::
Not all PDF readers support attachments, which may limit accessibility for some
users.

Extraction complexity::
Depending on the PDF reader, extracting attachments might be less
straightforward than working with separate files, potentially leading to user
frustration.

Preview limitations::
Unlike embedded multimedia content, attachments cannot be previewed from within
the PDF without being extracted first, which can be inconvenient for users.


== Metanorma support of PDF attachments

Metanorma supports attachments, making it possible to incorporate
and link to attachments to HTML and PDF outputs.

Metanorma supports embedding of any kind of file to a PDF, including source code
(e.g., `.c`, `.java`, `.py` files), data files (XML, JSON, YAML), other PDF
documents, executable binaries, images and multimedia files, and spreadsheets
and databases.

In HTML output, Metanorma handles attachments as individual files that are
linked from content. These attachments are placed in a separate directory
alongside the HTML file.

Given a Metanorma PDF files that contain attachments, users can easily download
these attachments by clicking on the provided links.


== Usage

Adding PDF attachments in Metanorma is a straightforward process.


=== Step 1: Encode file attachments in the bibliography

To add an attachment, you first need to encode it in the bibliography section of your Metanorma document.

Syntax:

[source,adoc]
----
* [[[attachment-anchor,attachment:({file-path-relative-to-root-document})]]]
----

Where,

`file-path-relative-to-root-document`:: is the path to the file you want to
attach, relative to the root document.

This syntax creates a bibliography entry for the attachment and assigns it an
anchor that can be referenced later in the document.

=== Step 2: Reference the attachment in the document

Once the attachment is added to the bibliography, one can reference it anywhere
in the document using the standard cross-reference syntax.

Syntax:

[source,adoc]
----
<<attachment-anchor>>
----

This will create a hyperlink to the attachment in the generated PDF.

=== Example: Attaching a C source file

Here's an example of how to attach a C source file to your Metanorma document:

[source,adoc]
----
== Scope

The C reference implementation source: <<file1>>. <2>

[bibliography]
== Bibliography

* [[[file1,attachment:(sources/program.c)]]] <1>
----
<1> The attachment is encoded in the bibliography section with the anchor `file1`.
<2> The C reference implementation source is located at `sources/program.c`.

In the rendered document:

* The bibliography will be empty because attachments are never shown.
* Clicking on the link `<<file1>>` will open the attached C source file.


=== Visual representation

When the PDF is generated, the attachment will be accessible through a hyperlink
in the document.

Here's how it looks:

Users can then save the attachment from the PDF file using a compatible PDF reader:
