= Document attributes (AsciiRFC v2)

[[note_general_doc_ref_doc_attrib_ietf]]
[NOTE]
====
The document attributes listed below are unique to Metanorma's processing of RFC XML v2
IETF documents. The document attributes particular to RFC XML v3, and used in the current version of
this gem, link:../document-attributes[are given separately].

For _common document attributes_, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[Document attributes reference] in general Metanorma author's documentation. That page describes attributes that apply to all Metanorma flavors, not just IETF.

For an _introduction to Metanorma AsciiDoc document attributes_ and how Metanorma uses them, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[the corresponding topic].
====

== Document type

`:doctype:`::
Specifies document status. Choices:
+
* `:doctype: internet-draft` sets the document as an Internet-Draft (default value):
** `rfc@docName` will be set to the `:name:` attribute
* `:doctype: rfc` sets the document as an RFC:
** `rfc@number` will be set to the `:name:` attribute
+
Defaults to `internet-draft`.

== Global options

`:no-rfc-bold-bcp14:`::
Optional. Default value `true`. Allowed values: `true`, `false`.
Override default assumption that boldface uppercase BCP14 word is to be rendered with `bcp14` tag.

`:smart-quotes:`::
Optional. Default value `true`. Allowed values: `true`, `false`.
Permit smart quotes, when they are specified explicitly in AsciiDoc (as `pass:["`...`"]`, `pass:['`...`']`).
When disabled, smart quotes are rendered as straight quotes, and Asciidoc's default conversion
of straight apostrophes to smart is undone.

`:inline-definition-lists:`::
Optional. Default value `false`. Allowed values: `true`, `false`.
Only applies to v2. By default, `<vspace blankLines="1">` is inserted after
the definition in a v2 definition list, to satisfy the requirement from `idnits` validation
that definition terms be separated by a carriage return from the definition. That is, by
default inline definition lists are rendered as paragraphing definition lists. If the option is
on, the additional `vspace` element is not added, and inline definition lists are left as is.

`:flush-caches:`::
Optional. Default value `false`. Allowed values: `true`, `false`.
Delete and reload the caches of references to be included externally, and of workgroups,
during processing of this document.
The caches are stored in `~/.metanorma-ietf-biblio-cache.json` and
`~/.metanorma-ietf-workgroup-cache.json`.

`:biblio-dir:`::
Optional. Name of directory. If present, gives the name of a
directory from which RFC XML references are to be read into the
document, rather than assuming the references are already present
in the document.

`:normative:`::
Optional. Comma-delimited list of reference anchors. Used in conjunction with `:biblio-dir:`, which uses a single directory for all references: this attribute
lists those references which are to be considered normative, and listed under the "`Normative References`" heading.

== Document attributes

Metanorma-IETF allows setting the RFC XML document header using the following
document attributes. Complying with AsciiDoc syntax, no blank lines are
permitted between the title, listing of authors, and the document attributes.
Also following AsciiDoc syntax, character entities will be ignored in the document
header: `\&nbsp;` in the header for example will be rendered as `&amp;nbsp;`.

NOTE: Most attributes listed here, unless specifically stated, are common between
AsciiRFC v3 (RFC XML v3) and AsciiRFC v2 (RFC XML v2).


`= Document Title`::
Mandatory. Title of document.
RFC XML: `rfc/front/title`

`:abbrev:`::
Mandatory. Abbreviation of document title. Usually the document name without
the keyword `draft-`.
RFC XML: `rfc/front/title@abbrev`

`:name`::
Mandatory. Sets the document's name. This should be a number if
the document is an RFC, and a name (in the form of `draft-ietf-somewg-someprotocol-07`)
if it is an Internet-Draft.
When `doctype` is set to:
+
* `internet-draft`: the value should be in the form `draft-ietf-somewg-someprotocol-07`.
** RFC XML: `rfc@docName`
* `rfc`: the value should be a number like `7991` as described
in  https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7991#section-2.47.6[here]
RFC XML: `rfc@number`
+
NOTE: Usage here differs from usage in AsciiRFC v3.

`:status`::

+
* `standard` (mapped in v2 to: `std`)
* `informational` (mapped in v2 to: `info`)
* `experimental` (mapped in v2 to: `exp`)
* `bcp`
* `historic`
+
RFC XML `rfc@category`
+
NOTE: Usage here differs from usage in AsciiRFC v3.

`:intended-series`::
Mandatory. Set the intended series of this
document. For Internet Drafts, this indicates the intended series once the document is published as an RFC. For RFCs, this indicates the current status of the document. The following values are allowed:
+
* `standard` (I.-D. only) (mapped in v2 to: `std`)
* `informational` (mapped in v2 to: `info`)
* `experimental` (mapped in v2 to: `exp`)
* `bcp` (I.-D. only)

* `fyi` (I.-D. only)
* `fyi nnnn` (RFC only, where `nnnn` is the document number)
* `full-standard` (I.-D. only)  (mapped in v2 to: `std`)
* `full-standard nnnn` (RFC only, where `nnnn` is the document number) (mapped in v2 to: `std`)
* `historic`
+
RFC XML `front/@category` (`exp` and `historic` only supported for Internet Drafts; document number not used)
+
NOTE: Usage here differs from usage in AsciiRFC v3.

`:series-no:`::
Optional. The document series is defined by the `category` attribute;
`seriesNo` is only applicable to the values _info_ ("FYI" series),
_std_ ("STD" series), and _bcp_ ("BCP" series). RFC XML v3 counterpart: `rfc@seriesNo`
+
NOTE: This attribute is only available in AsciiRFC v3.

`:submission-type`::
Set document submission type for this document. The following values are allowed:
+
* `IETF` (default)

`:revdate:`::
Optional. Latest revision date of document. Default value is current time.
Accepts ISO 8601 date. Also accepts `YYYY` year, and `YYYY[-]MM` year/month.
For consistency with AsciiDoc, `:revdate:` is given as
an ISO 8601 date; the converter breaks it down into day, month name and year
RFC XML: `front/date@day`, `front/date@month`, `front/date@year`

`:area:`::
Optional. Comma delimited text on which IETF area this document relates to. Value should
"be either the full name or the abbreviation of one of the IETF areas as

== Author attributes

As multiple authors can be specified, the document attribute to specify the
first author uses a unsuffixed attribute name `:role`, and the second author's
attributes onwards use a numeric suffix to identify the author: `:role_2`, `:role_3`, etc.

== Attributes for `xml2rfc` processing instructions

The `xml2rfc` tool accepts processing instructions of the form `<?rfc keyword='value'?>`:
see https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/authoring/README.html#processing.instructions .
(Of these, `sort-refs`, `sym-refs` and `toc-include` are also present in the
RFC XML v3 specification, as attributes of the
root `rfc` element: link:/author/ietf/ref/document-attributes[v3-specific document attributes].)

Those processing instructions which apply to the entire document can also be
specified in Metanorma-IETF as document attributes.

=== Processing instructions for `xml2rfc`

The `xml2rfc` tool accepts processing instructions of the form `<?rfc keyword='value'?>`:
see https://xml2rfc.tools.ietf.org/authoring/README.html#processing.instructions .
(Of these, `sort-refs`, `sym-refs` and `toc-include`  are also present in the
RFC XML v3 specification, as attributes of the
root `rfc` element: link:/author/ietf/ref/document-attributes[v3-specific document attributes].)
Those processing instructions which apply to the entire document can also be
specified in Metanorma-IETF as document options.


`:artworkdelimiter:`::
when producing `txt` or `nroff` files, use this string to delimit artwork

`:artworklines:`::
when producing txt or nroff files, add this many blank lines around artwork

`:authorship:`::
render author information

`:autobreaks:`::
automatically force page breaks to avoid widows and orphans (not perfect)

`:background:`::
when producing a HTML file, use this image

`:colonspace:`::
put two spaces instead of one after each colon ("`:`") in txt or nroff files

`:comments:`::
render `<cref>` information

`:compact:`::
when producing a txt/nroff file, try to conserve vertical whitespace (the default value is the current value of the `rfcedstyle` PI)

`:docmapping:`::
use hierarchical tags (e.g., `<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.) for (sub)section titles

`:editing:`::
insert editing marks for ease of discussing draft versions

`:emoticonic:`::
automatically replaces input sequences such as `|*text|` by, e.g., `<strong>text</strong>` in html output

`:footer:`::
override the center footer string

`:header:`::
override the leftmost header string

`:inline:`::
if comments is "yes", then render comments inline; otherwise render them in an "Editorial Comments" section

`:iprnotified:`::
include boilerplate from Section 10.4(d) of http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2026

`:linkmailto:`::
generate mailto: URL, as appropriate

`:linefile:`::
a string like "35:file.xml" or just "35" (file name then defaults to the containing file's real name or to the latest linefile specification that changed it) that will be used to override xml2rfc's reckoning of the current input position (right after this PI) for warning and error reporting purposes (line numbers are 1-based)

`:notedraftinprogress:`::
generates "(work in progress)", as appropriate

`:private:`::
produce a private memo rather than an RFC or Internet-Draft

`:refparent:`::
title of the top-level section containing all references

`:rfcedstyle:`::
`:rfcedstyle:`::
attempt to closely follow finer details from the latest observable RFC-Editor style so as to minimize the probability of being sent back corrections after submission. +
+
This directive is a kludge whose exact behavior is likely to change on a regular basis to match the current flavor of the month; presently, it will: +
+
* capitalize the adjective "`This`" in automatically generated headings,
* use the variant "`acknowledgement`" spelling instead of Merriam Webster's main "`acknowledgment`" dictionary entry,
* use the "`eMail`" spelling instead of Knuth's more modern "`email`" spelling,
* only put one blank line instead of two before top sections,
* omit "`Intellectual Property and Copyright Statements`" and "`Author's Address`" from the table of content, and
* not limit the indentation to a maximum tag length in `<references>` sections.

`:rfcprocack:`::
if there already is an automatically generated Acknowledg(e)ment section, pluralize its title and add a short sentence acknowledging that xml2rfc was used in the document's production to process an input XML source file in RFC-2629 format

`:slides:`::
when producing a html file, produce multiple files for a slide show

`:sort-refs:`::
(`sortrefs`) sort references

`:strict:`::
try to enforce the ID-nits conventions and DTD validity

`:subcompact:`::
if compact is "yes", then you can make things a little less compact by setting this to "no" (the default value is the current value of the compact PI)

`:sym-refs:`::
(`symrefs`) use anchors rather than numbers for references

`:text-list-symbols:`::
modify the list of symbols used (when generated text) for list type="symbols". For example, specifying "abcde" will cause "a" to be used for 1st level, "b" for the 2nd level, etc, cycling back to the first character "a" at the 6th level. Specifying "o*" will cause the characters "o" and "*" to be alternated for each successive level.

`:toc-include:`::
(`toc`) generate a table-of-contents

`:tocappendix:`::
control whether the word "Appendix" appears in the table-of-content

`:toc-depth:`::
if `:toc-include:` is "yes", then this determines the depth of the table-of-contents

`:tocindent:`::
if `:toc-include:` is "yes", then setting this to "yes" will indent subsections in the table-of-contents

`:tocnarrow:`::
affects horizontal spacing in the table-of-content

`:tocompact:`::
if `:toc-include:` is "yes", then setting this to "no" will make it a little less compact

`:topblock:`::
put the famous header block on the first page

`:useobject:`::
when producing a HTML file, use the `<object>` HTML element with inner replacement content instead of the `<img>` HTML element, when a source XML element includes an `src` attribute


Exceptionally, `compact`, `toc-include`, `sym-refs`, `sort-refs` and `strict` are is set by default to `yes`, `subcompact` to `no`, and `toc-depth` to 4.

The additional document option `rfc2629xslt` (default value: true) injects into the document header the processing
instruction `<?xml-stylesheet type="text/xsl" href="rfc2629.xslt" ?>`, which impacts on the output of xml2rfc.
