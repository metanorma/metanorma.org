= Metanorma Asciidoc markup

This documents the previous version of Metanorma Asciidoc aligned with
v2 RFC XML [deprecated in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ietf/releases/tag/v2.0.0].
The link:markup.adoc[current version of Asciidoc for IETF], which is aligned with v3 RFC XML,
is much closer aligned to the rest of Metanorma than this version.

Previous versions of this gem also supported a version of Asciidoc aligned to v3 RFC XML.
However the schema they supported was purely the version documented in RFC 7991, which
has never been supported by IETF unmodified, and which will not compile under v3 tools;
so we no longer document that version of markup.

link:markup-v2tov3.adoc[A comparison of the two markups] is also provided, and can be
used to convert documents marked up for v2 RFC XML to documents for v3 RFC XML.

== Sections

=== Abstract

Any paragraphs following the document header are treated as the abstract
(`front/abstract`), whether or not they are in abstract style. The abstract is
terminated by either the first section header (which ends the document
preamble), or an admonition (e.g. `note`).

Any admonitions before the first section header are treated as notes (`front/note`).

[source,asciidoc]

== Blocks

=== Examples

RFC XML does not recognize examples as a distinct element. Under v2, any Metanorma AsciiDoc
example blocks are treated by default as `figure`; if they do not contain source code,
code listing, mathematical formatting or Ascii art, they are treated as a block of text.

=== Source code listings

In RFC XML, `artwork` elements only occur within a
`figure` wrapper; Metanorma-IETF supplies that wrapper if it is not provided
explicitly.

=== ASCII Art and Images

In RFC XML, `artwork` elements only occur within a
`figure` wrapper; Metanorma-IETF supplies that wrapper if it is not provided
explicitly.

<19> `figure/postamble` 


=== Mathematical examples

In order for mathematical formatting to be recognised in Asciidoc, the document attribute `:stem:` needs to be set.

[source,asciidoc]
--
:stem:

[stem]
++++
sqrt(4) = 2
++++
--

Mathematical examples are treated identically to literals, and are rendered as `artwork`;
however their default alignment is set as `center`. As with inline stem expressions, they are treated identically
to monospace expressions in the RFC XML output; they are not currently rendered as MathML or any other notation.

=== Lists

[source,asciidoc]
--
[empty=true,hang-indent=n] <1>
* Unordered list 1 <2>
* Unordered list 2 <2>
** Nested list <3>

[counter=token,hang-indent=n,format=List #%d,arabic|loweralpha|upperralpha|lowerroman|upperroman] <4>
. A <5>
. B <5>
--
<1> `ul@style = empty`, `ul@hangIndent` 
<2> `list[@style="symbols"]/t`
<3> `list[@style="symbols"]/t/list[@style="symbols"]/t`
<4> `list/counter`,  `list@hangIndent`, `list@style = format List #%d`, `list@style` (for arabic|loweralpha|upperralpha|lowerroman|upperroman) 
<5> `list/t`

Unlike Metanorma AsciiDoc, v2 RFC Asciidoc does not permit anchors on list items: the anchors in the following are ignored.

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[id1]] A

. [[id2]] A
--

RFC XML v2 does not support multi-paragraph list items. Following the specification recommendation,
paragraphs within v2 list items are replaced with `vspace` tages.

=== Definition Lists

[source,asciidoc]
--
[hang-indent=n] <1>
A:: B <2>
--
<1> `list@hangIndent` 
<2> `list[@style="hanging"]/t@hangText`, `list[@style="hanging"]/t`

In RFC XML v2, `idnits` considers inline definition lists invalid; Metanorma
renders them as paragraphed definition lists. The gem option `:inline-definition-lists`
disables this behaviour.

Metanorma AsciiDoc does not permit anchors on either definition list terms,
or definition list definitions: the anchors in the following are ignored.

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[id1]] A:: [[id2]]B
--

RFC XML v2 does not support multi-paragraph list items. Following the specification recommendation,
paragraphs within v2 list items are replaced with `vspace` tages.

=== Tables

The converter respects the AsciiDoc (horizontal) align attributes of cells
and column widths.

(Exceptionally,
column widths specified for v2 as `"1,1,1,1,1,1...."` will be ignored, since AsciiDoc
internally treats them identically to unspecified column widths on a table.)

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[id]] <1>
[suppress-title=true|false,align=left|center|right,grid=all|cols|none|rows] <2>
.Table Title <3>
|===
|[[id]] head | head <4>

h|header cell | body cell <5>
| | body cell <5>

|foot | foot <5>
|===
--
<1> `texttable@anchor`
<2> `texttable@suppress-title`, `texttable@align`, `texttable@style`. Mapping of AsciiDoc grid attribute to RFC XML style attribute is: `all` > `all`, `cols` > `full`, `none` > `none`, `rows` > `headers` (although the two are not strictly equivalent).
<3> `texttable@title`
<4> `texttable/ttcol@id`, `texttable/ttcol`
<5> `texttable/c`

NOTE: v3 permits table cells to contain block elements, such as paragraphs and lists. (This is done in AsciiDoc by prefixing
the table cell with `a|`.) However v2 only permits inline tagging within cells. Paragraph tags (`<t>`) are stripped by the gem.

=== Paragraphs

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[id]] <1>
Paragraph text <2>
--
<1> `t@anchor`
<2> `<t>Paragraph text</t>`

=== Comments

==== AsciiDoc comments

Metanorma AsciiDoc implements both inline comments (prefixed with `\\`)
and block comments (prefixed with `\\\\`). Both are ignored
and are not rendered in any output, including RFC XML.

AsciiDoc for v2 RFC XML also permits paragraphs and open blocks (which can contain
multiple paragraphs) to be treated as AsciiDoc comments, if
they have the style attribute `[comment]`:

[source,asciidoc]
----

// This is an inline AsciiDoc comment, which will not be output to XML.

[comment]
This is a single paragraph AsciiDoc comment,
which will not be output to XML.

////
This is a block AsciiDoc comment,

which will not be output to XML.
////

[comment]
--
This is a

multiple paragraph

AsciiDoc comment, which will not be output to XML.
--
----

==== XML comments

XML inline comments may be introduced into XML through the `[comment]`
formatting macro: any such comments may not span more than one line.

[source,asciidoc]
--
Text [comment]#This is a comment# Text
--

The foregoing will be rendered in RFC XML as:

[source,xml]
--
<t>Text <!-- This is a comment --> Text</t>
--

XML block comments are introduced through the role attribute
`[.comment]`, which can be prefixed to a paragraph or an open
block (which can contain multiple paragraphs):

[source,asciidoc]
----
[.comment]
This is a single paragraph XML comment.

[.comment]
--
This is a

multiple paragraph

XML comment.
--
----

==== Text Comments

RFC XML provides for editorial comments which may optionally appear
in the published text (subject to the `comments` processing instruction).

AsciiRFC marks text comments up as admonitions.

NOTE: `cref` is NOT supported in Metanorma IETF for v2 RFC XML. This is to make
the treatment of admonitions consistent between this gem and the
rest of metanorma. If v2 RFC XML cref is required, use the
deprecated `asciidoctor-rfc` gem instead.

In Metanorma IETF for v2 RFC XML, admonitions are rendered as the capitalized
admonition type (e.g. NOTE, TIP), followed by the text of the admonition.

[source,asciidoc]
--
NOTE: Any admonition inside the body of the text is a comment. <1>
// Note that actual AsciiDoc comments are ignored by the converter.

[[id]] <2>
[NOTE,source=name] <3>
====
Any admonition inside the body of the text is a comment.
====
--
<1> `<cref>Any admonition inside the body of the text is a comment.</cref>`
<2> `cref@anchor`
<3> `cref@source`







=== Inline markup

=== Indexing

[source,asciidoc]
--
This ((<indexterm>)) <1>
is visible in the text,
this one is not (((indexterm, index-subterm))). <2>
--
<1> `<iref item="indexterm">indexterm</iref>`
<2> `<iref item="indexterm" subitem="index-subterm"/>`


=== Inline formatting

[source,asciidoc]
--
Linebreak: + <1>
_Italic_ <2>
*Bold* <3>
`Monospace` <4>
~subscript~ <5>
^superscript^ <6>
[bcp14]#MUST NOT# <7>
stem:[sqrt(4) = 2] <8>
--
<1> That is, "+ " at the end of a line. `<vspace/>`.
<2> `<spanx style="emph">Italic</spanx>`
<3> `<spanx style="strong">Bold</spanx>`
<4> `<spanx style="verb">Monospace</spanx>`
<5> Not supported in v2; rendered as `\_subscript_`
<6> Not supported in v2; rendered as `\^superscript^`
<7> Not supported in v2; rendered as `<spanx style="strong">MUST NOT</spanx>`.
<8> Stem expressions are treated identically to monospace expressions; they are not currently rendered as MathML or any other notation.

NOTE: The delimiters must occur within the one line; the following is invalid in Metanorma AsciiDoc:
[source,asciidoc]
--
*WOULD
PROBABLY*
--

Any formatting XML spans within `spanx` elements are stripped in postprocessing.

=== Cross-References

[source,asciidoc]
----
Content content content
<<crossreference>> <1>
<<crossreference,text>> <2>
<<crossreference,format=(counter|title|none|default): text>> <3>
http://example.com/[linktext] <4>
----
<1> `<xref target="crossreference"/>`
<2> `<xref target="crossreference">text</xref>`
<3> `<xref format="counter|title|none|default" target="crossreference">text</xref>`
<4> `<eref href="http://example.com/">linktext</eref>`

In v2, `relref` style crossreferences to bibliographic entries are rendered as equivalent `xref` crossreferences,
inserting section numbers as appropriate.

Note that fragments (e.g. `crossreference#fragment`) are not supported on the `xref@target` attribute:
the RFC XML specification requires that the `xref@target` attribute equals
the value of an anchor attribute elsewhere in the document.

Internal crossreferences and bibliographic references are marked up in the same way; but
bibliographic references are marked up separately from the main flow of Metanorma IETF AsciiDoc, and are
processed later.

NOTE: If you have a citation of a bibliographic item which is identical to a section title (e.g. you have a
bibliographic citation with the anchor "`WHIRLPOOL`", and a section with the title "`WHIRLPOOL`"),
Metanorma will correctly pick the former as the target of the reference, so long as that section
has a different anchor ID:
--
[source,asciidoc]
----
[[hash_whirlpool]]
=== WHIRLPOOL

The WHIRLPOOL hash function is defined in <<WHIRLPOOL>>.

This section should actually be referenced as <<hash_whirlpool>>.
