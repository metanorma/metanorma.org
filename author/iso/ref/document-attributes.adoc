[NOTE]
====
The document attributes listed below are unique to Metanorma's processing of ISO documents.

For _common document attributes_, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes[Document attributes reference] in general Metanorma author's documentation. That page describes attributes that apply to all Metanorma flavors, not just ISO.

For an _introduction to Metanorma AsciiDoc document attributes_ and how Metanorma uses them, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[the corresponding topic].
====


== Document information

`:docnumber:`:: The ISO document number without any part. +
+
.Example of setting `:docnumber:`
[example]
====
For ISO 8601-1:2019, the `docnumber` is `8601`.

For ISO 24229:2022, the `docnumber` is `24229`.
====

`:partnumber:`:: The ISO document part number. This can be "`part-subpart`" if this is an ISO/IEC or IEC document. +
+
.Example of setting `:partnumber:`
[example]
====
For ISO 10303-2:2022, the `partnumber` is `2`.

For ISO 8000-118, the `partnumber` is `118`.
====

`:docidentifier:`:: The full document identiifer assembled out of component metadata,
rather than relying on the provided metadata to build it up.

NOTE: For a committee document, provide the N-document number for this attribute.
The N-document number is normally specified to Metanorma as `:tc-docnumber` for drafts:
see <<distribution-group,Distribution group>>.

`:doctype:`:: Has its possible values defined by
https://www.iso.org/deliverables-all.html[ISO deliverables: The different types of ISO publications]
(mandatory). Permitted types are:

`international-standard`::: International Standard (IS)
`technical-specification`::: Technical Specification (TR)
`technical-report`::: Technical Report (TR)
`publicly-available-specification`::: Publicly Available Specification (PAS)
`international-workshop-agreement`::: International Workshop Agreement (IWA)
`guide`::: Guide (Guide)
`technical-corrigendum`::: Technical Corrigendum (Cor) [added in https://github.com/metanorma/isodoc/releases/tag/v1.3.25]
`amendment`::: Amendment (Amd) [added in https://github.com/metanorma/isodoc/releases/tag/v1.3.25]
`committee-document`::: Committee Document (for internal documents) [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.7.2]
`addendum`::: Addendum (Add) [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.8.8]

`:updates-document-type:`::
(only when `doctype` is set to `amendment`, `technical-corrigendum`, or `addendum`)
The document type that this amendment, technical corrigendum or addendum is
updating [added in https://github.com/metanorma/isodoc/releases/tag/v1.3.25].

`:docsubtype:`:: A subclass of doctype for which special processing rules apply.

`:vocabulary`:::
The "vocabulary" document type is defined in the
https://www.iso.org/ISO-house-style.html[ISO House Rules]
and title requirements defined in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2018, 11.5.2.
The initial clause of the terms section,
"`For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply`",
is deleted; terminological entries are permitted outside of
Clause 3. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v1.8.2]

`:docstage:`:: The stage code for the document status (see
https://www.iso.org/stage-codes.html[International harmonized stage codes]).
Synonym of `:status:`.
+
--
NOTE: Typically, ISO authors create Metanorma documents at stages `00` through `40`
(PWI `00.`, AWI, NP, WD, CD, DIS).
Documents at the final stages, `50` and `60` (FDIS, PRF, IS), are created by
ISO Editorial Program Managers at ISO/CS (aka ISO EPMs, ISO Editors), and the
EPMs are expected to provide the Project Leader with
Authors using Metanorma are not expected to edit documents at those stages, and
are not necessary in a normal submission process.
These stages, however, can be used for mirroring and tracking of final stage
and published standards, which many authors do.
--

//Note contains process information. Do not explain process in Ref but link to ISO Flavor page.

`:docsubstage:`:: The substage code for the document status (see
https://www.iso.org/stage-codes.html[International harmonized stage codes]).
If this is left out, a substage of "`00`" is assumed, with the exception of
stage "`60`" (published), where a substage of "`60`" is assumed.
("`60.00`" is the final proof "`PRF stage`", "`60.60`" the published document "`published`".)

`:horizontal:`:: Whether the document is a horizontal standard. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v1.5.13]

`true`::: The document is a horizontal standard.
`false`::: (default) The document is not a horizontal standard.

`:fast-track:`:: Whether the document is a fast-track standard. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.7.0]

`true`::: The document is a fast-track standard.
`false`::: (default) The document is not a fast-track standard.

`:document-scheme:`::
Specifies the version of the ISO document specification that should be used in
generating the Metanorma document.
 [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.7.1]
+
When omitted, the scheme to apply is inferred from the `:copyright-year:`
document attribute, if set. Otherwise, the current default scheme is
applied. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.7.6].
+
NOTE: Currently used only to specify the PDF layout.

`2024`::: (default) Latest document layout as of 2024 (default)
`2013`::: Document layout used from 2013 to early 2024.
`2012`::: Document layout used from mid-2012 to 2013. It is equivalent to the `1989` layout with a logo change.
`1989`::: Document layout used from 1989 to mid-2012.
`1987`::: Document layout used from 1987 to 1989.
`1972`::: Document layout used from 1972 to 1987.
`1951`::: Document layout used from 1951 to 1971. The first available published ISO layout.


`:semantic-metadata-feedback-link:`:: (only for `document-scheme` value `2024`)
Specifies the URL for any feedback to be provided for the
ISO document. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.7.1]
In the PDF layout of 2024 it is used to generate cover page QR code.

`:library-ics:`:: The ICS (International Categorization for Standards) number for the document.
There may be more than one ICS for a document; if so, they should be comma-delimited.

`:classification:`::
+
--
(for `document-scheme` values of `1989` and prior, and a publication date of 1994 onwards)

The
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Decimal_Classification[Universal Decimal Classification (UDC)]
code(s) for the document. In publication years prior to 1994, ISO used
UDC instead of ICS (which was published in 1992) in publications. This
corresponds to document schemes of `1989` and
prior. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.7.2]

UDC is a rather complex scheme with logical operators.

Values are prefixed with `UDC:`. Note that UDC uses punctuation symbols,
including colon, but not comma.

If multiple values are present, the classification token is repeated, and comma
delimited.

NOTE: The exception is that ISO | CIE co-publications use UDCs in addition to ICS
as CIE uses UDC.

`:price-code:`:: price code group of publication, as documented in the
https://www.iec.ch/members_experts/tools/pdf/IEC_DATA_FEEDS.pdf[IEC Data Feeds: Technical documentation document] [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.8.10]

=== Document identifier

==== General

The ISO document identifier is assembled out of these metadata elements:

publisher:: publisher of the document
document stage:: stage of development of document, according to the Harmonized Stage Codes
document number:: numeric identifier of document
update number:: serial number of update (for amendments, addenda, and technical corrigenda)
document type:: type of ISO deliverable
copyright year:: year of publication of document
language:: language of document

==== Publisher

This is the abbreviation of the publishing organization, typically `ISO` if
ISO is the only publisher.

If the document is published under co-publishing agreements, it can contain the
abbreviations of other publishing SDOs, delimited by `;` after `ISO`. An `IWA`
document has publisher abbreviation of `IWA`. (These will be rendered with the expected
`/` in the document identifier.)

The prefixes occur in the order that they are given in `publisher`.

Attributes:

`:publisher:`:: Publisher of the document. Accepted values are:

`ISO`::: ISO.
`ISO;IEC`::: Joint ISO and IEC. (e.g. ISO/IEC JTC 1 and ISO/IEC JTC 2 documents)
`IEC;ISO`::: Joint IEC and ISO. (e.g. IEC/ISO SMART documents)
`ISO;IEC;IEEE`::: Joint ISO/IEC/IEEE.
`ISO;IEEE`::: Joint ISO/IEEE.
`ISO;SAE`::: Joint ISO/SAE.
`IWA`::: International Workshop Agreement.


In the case of IEC/ISO, both `:publisher:` and `:copyright-holder:` need to
be set for the document identifier and the logos to be in correct order.

[example]
.Setting IEC and ISO as copyright holders for an IEC/ISO document
====
[source,adoc]
----
:publisher: IEC;ISO
:copyright-holder: IEC;ISO
----
====

NOTE: `ISO` is no longer forced to appear
first [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.0.9].


==== Document type and stage

ISO document stages in document identifiers are mapped as follows.

International Standard::

`00.00` to `00.99`::: "`PWI`"
`10.00` to `10.98`::: "`NP`"
`10.99` to `20.00`::: "`AWI`"
`20.20` to `20.99`::: "`WD`"
`30.00` to `30.99`::: "`CD`"
`40.00` to `40.99`::: "`DIS`"
`50.00` to `50.99`::: "`FDIS`"
`60.00`::: "`PRF`"
`60.60`::: empty designation

Technical Specification, Technical Report::

`00.00` to `00.99`::: "`PWI {TR,TS}`"
`10.00` to `10.98`::: "`NP {TR,TS}`"
`10.99` to `20.00`::: "`AWI {TR,TS}`"
`20.20` to `20.99`::: "`WD {TR,TS}`"
`30.00` to `30.99`::: "`CD {TR,TS}`"
`40.00` to `40.99`::: TS/TRs do not have DIS stage because they are not international standards.
`50.00` to `50.99`::: TS/TRs do not have FDIS stage because they are not international standards.
`60.00`::: "`PRF {TR,TS}`"
`60.60`::: "`{TR,TS}`"

//The stage abbreviations DIS and FDIS change to DTS and FDTS

Amendment::

`00.00` to `00.99`::: "`{base-document-id}/PWI Amd {num}`"
`10.00` to `10.98`::: "`{base-document-id}/NP Amd {num}`"
`10.99` to `20.00`::: "`{base-document-id}/AWI Amd {num}`"
`20.20` to `20.99`::: "`{base-document-id}/WD Amd {num}`"
`30.00` to `30.99`::: "`{base-document-id}/CD Amd {num}`"
`40.00` to `40.99`::: "`{base-document-id}/DAmd {num}`"
`50.00` to `50.99`::: "`{base-document-id}/FDAmd {num}`"
`60.00`::: "`{base-document-id}/PRF Amd {num}`"
`60.60`::: "`{base-document-id}/Amd {num}`"

Technical Corrigendum::

`00.00` to `00.99`::: "`{base-document-id}/PWI Cor {num}`"
`10.00` to `10.98`::: "`{base-document-id}/NP Cor {num}`"
`10.99` to `20.00`::: "`{base-document-id}/AWI Cor {num}`"
`20.20` to `20.99`::: "`{base-document-id}/WD Cor {num}`"
`30.00` to `30.99`::: "`{base-document-id}/CD Cor {num}`"
`40.00` to `40.99`::: "`{base-document-id}/DIS Cor {num}`"
`50.00` to `50.99`::: "`{base-document-id}/FDCor {num}`"
`60.00`::: "`{base-document-id}/PRF Cor {num}`"
`60.60`::: "`{base-document-id}/Cor {num}`"


When the Publisher element contains a "`slash`" ("`/`"), the separation in front of the document stage will be converted into an empty space.

[example]
.Differentiating single and dual publisher document identifiers
====
* `ISO/NP 33333` but `ISO/IEC NP 33333`
* `ISO/NP TR 33333` but `ISO/IEC NP TR 33333`
====


==== Document stage iteration number

According to ISO Directives Part 1 (11ed), SE.2:

[quote]
____
"`Working drafts (WD), committee drafts (CD), draft International Standards
(DIS), final draft International Standards (FDIS) and International Standards`"
and
"`Successive DIS on the same subject will carry the same number but will be
distinguished by a numerical suffix (.2, .3, etc.).
____

Metanorma names the stage iteration number accordingly for all stages, which is
patterned as:

* No suffix if iteration is 1: `{document stage}`
* Suffix including iteration number after 1: `{document stage}.{iteration number}`

Once the document is published (stage 60 substage 60), no status abbreviation is
given.


==== Full document identifier patterns

The patterns are as follows:

*International Standard*::
`{publisher} (/{document type and stage})? ({document number}) (- {part number})? (: {copyright year}) ({ISO 639 language code})?` +
+
[example]
.Examples of ISO International Standard document identifiers
====
* `ISO/IEEE/FDIS 33333-2`
* `ISO/IEEE 33333-2:2030(E)`
====

*Technical Report*, *Technical Specification*::
`{publisher} (/{document type and stage}) ({document number}) (- {part number})? (: {copyright year}) ({ISO 639 language code})?` +
+
[example]
.Examples of ISO TR and TS document identifiers
====
* `ISO/IEC/FDIS TS 33333-2`
* `ISO/TR 33333-2:2030(E)`
* `ISO/IEC TR 33333-2:2030(E)`
====

*Amendment*, *Technical Corrigendum*, *Addendum*::
`{source document ID}/{document type and stage} {update number} (: {copyright year}) ({ISO 639 language code})?` +
+
[example]
.Examples of ISO Amendment, Technical Corrigendum, and Addendum document identifiers
====
* `ISO 33333-2:2030/DIS Amd 2:2031`
* `ISO 33333-2:2030/Cor 2:2032`
* `ISO/IEC 33333-2:2030/Add 2:2032`
====


=== Title

ISO deliverables have titles that support different title components,
and can be multilingual:

* Introductory title (optional)
* Main title (mandatory)
* Part title (optional)

NOTE: In the case where an ISO deliverable title has multiple elements, care
should be taken when assigning them to title components. For instance, a not
necessarily mean that the document has a part title.

.Example of title with multiple elements but no part title
[example]
====
ISO/IEC 27001:2022 has the title:
"Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection -- Information
security management systems -- Requirements" that
is encoded as:

[source,adoc]
----
:title-intro-en: Information security, cybersecurity and privacy protection -- Information security management systems
:title-main-en: Information security management systems -- Requirements
----

Notice that there is no part title, as it is not a part standard (e.g. "Part 1").
====

.Example of title with a part title
[example]
====
ISO 10303-11:2004 has the title:
"Industrial automation systems and integration -- Product data representation
and exchange -- Part 11: Description methods: The EXPRESS language reference
manual"
and is encoded as:

[source,adoc]
----
:title-intro-en: Industrial automation systems and integration
:title-main-en: Product data representation and exchange
:title-part-en: Description methods: The EXPRESS language reference manual
----

Since this is a part standard ("Part 11"), the last title element is assigned as the part title.
====

Attributes:

`:title-intro-{en,fr}:`:: The introductory component of the English or French
title of the document.

`:title-main-{en,fr}:`:: The main component of the English or French title
of the document (mandatory).

`:title-part-{en,fr}:`:: The English or French title of the document part.

`:title-amendment-{en,fr}:`:: (only when `doctype` is set to `amendment` or `technical-corrigendum`)
The English or French title of the amendment [added in https://github.com/metanorma/isodoc/releases/tag/v1.3.25]

`:title-addendum-{en,fr}:`:: (only when `doctype` is set to `addendum`)
The English or French title of the addendum [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.8.8]

`:amendment-number:`:: (only when `doctype` is set to `amendment`)
The number of the amendment [added in https://github.com/metanorma/isodoc/releases/tag/v1.3.25]

`:addendum-number:`:: (only when `doctype` is set to `addendum`)
The number of the addendum [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.8.8]

`:corrigendum-number:`:: (only when `doctype` is set to `technical-corrigendum`)
The number of the technical corrigendum [added in https://github.com/metanorma/isodoc/releases/tag/v1.3.25]

NOTE: These `:title-*` document attributes are used instead
of the `metanorma-standoc` `:title:` attribute and the default AsciiDoc title
(the first line of the document header, prefixed with `=`),
due to the complexity of ISO deliverable titles.

NOTE: This document template presupposes authoring in English; a different
template will be needed for French, including French titles of document
components such as annexes.


== Authorship and editorial information

=== General

There are potentially three types of groups involved in an ISO deliverable:

. the *drafting group*: where the deliverable is created and worked on
(mandatory);

. the *approval group*: where the deliverable gets approved for publication,
typically a TC or SC (optional);

. the *distribution group*: where the deliverable is distributed for review,
depending on where the deliverable gets distributed to (optional).

=== Approval group

The *approval group* is typically the ISO Technical Committee, Subcommittee or
Working Group responsible for approving a draft.
The method of specifying metadata of the *approval group* is identical to that
of specifying the *drafting group* (see <<drafting-group>>).

If at least the `:approval-technical-committee-number:` is not provided, the
editing groups are assumed to also be the
approval group. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.1.2].

`:approval-agency:`:: The agency or agencies of the *approval group*. Defaults to `ISO` if
not supplied; the only alternate value is `ISO/IEC`, for JTCs. (For the drafting group,
the agencies are taken from the `publisher` attribute.)

`:approval-technical-committee-number:`:: The number of the relevant ISO
technical committee.

`:approval-technical-committee-type:`:: The type of the relevant technical committee.
Defaults to `TC` if not supplied.

`:approval-technical-committee:`:: The name of the relevant ISO technical committee.

`:approval-subcommittee-number:`:: The number of the relevant ISO subcommittee.

`:approval-subcommittee-type:`:: The type of the relevant ISO subcommittee.
Defaults to `SC` if not supplied.

`:approval-subcommittee:`:: The name of the relevant ISO subcommittee.

`:approval-workgroup-number:`:: The number of the relevant ISO working group.

`:approval-workgroup-type:`:: The type of the relevant ISO working group.
Defaults to `WG` if not supplied.

`:approval-workgroup::`:: The name of the relevant ISO working group.

=== Distribution group

`:tc-docnumber:`:: The document number assigned by a *distribution group*
(also called the "`N-document number`" or the "`N-number`"), typically a
Technical Committee, a Subcommittee or a Working Group.

== Document relations

Metanorma allows for encoding of document relations supported by ISOSTS.

They are populated in the same manner of other document relation attributes.
Please refer to link:/author/ref/document-attributes/#document-relations[Document relations]
for details.

The following document relations are compatible with ISOSTS with their
individual mappings shown [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v1.10.4].

`:revises:`:: ISOSTS `revises`
`:replaces:`:: ISOSTS `replaces`
`:amends:`:: ISOSTS `amends`
`:corrects:`:: ISOSTS `corrects`
`:informatively-cited-in:`:: ISOSTS `informativelyReferencedBy`
`:informatively-cites:`:: ISOSTS `informativelyReferences`
`:normatively-cited-in:`:: ISOSTS `normativelyReferencedBy`
`:normatively-cites:`:: ISOSTS `normativelyReferences`
`:identical-adopted-from:`:: ISOSTS `isIdenticalNationalStandardOf`

== Visual appearance

`:iso-word-template:`:: For Word output, pick the styles template
to use [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.1.2].
Options are:

`simple`:::
Commonly called the "Simple Template".
Using the styles of the https://www.iso.org/iso-templates.html[ISO Simple Template] (default for stages before 40).

`dis`:::
Commonly called the "DIS Template".
Using the styles of the "`ISO Edited DIS template`", introduced by the ISO
editors at the DIS stage of editing, through to publication. (default for stages
40 through 95)

`:iso-word-bg-strip-color:`::
(only for the `dis` template)
The "`ISO Edited DIS template`" introduces background colouring of spans in
order to ensure correct semantic markup, as validated by ISO editors.

`true`::: (default) Remove background colors of semantically-annotated
spans (equivalent to "Pattern: Clear"). This option is _necessary_ for draft
submission of the stage 40 onwards (DIS/FDIS) documents to ISO
editors. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.2.3].

`false`::: Retain background colors of semantically-annotated spans.


== Validation

`:validate-years:`:: If not set, four-digit numbers that could plausibly be years (between 1900 and 2050)
are not warned about. If set,
they are included in validation [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.4.4].
