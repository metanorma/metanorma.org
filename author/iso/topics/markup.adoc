= Metanorma for ISO markup

== Document layouts

=== General

Metanorma ISO supports multiple layouts of ISO documents through the
`:document-scheme:` document attribute.

Specific instructions on using these layouts are described below.

=== 2024 (latest)

The following attributes should be set:

* `:semantic-metadata-feedback-link:` which is used to generate cover page QR code.
* `:library-ics:` to set the ICS code(s).

=== 2013

The following attributes should be set:

* `:library-ics:` to set the ICS code(s).

=== 2012

The 2012 PDF layout, published in mid-2012, is equal to the 1989 layout with an
ISO logo update.

The following attributes should be set:

* `:library-ics:` to set the ICS code(s).


=== 1989

The following attributes should be set.

From publication year 1994 and onwards:

* `:library-ics:` to set the ICS code(s).

Prior to publication year 1994:

* `:classification:` to set the UDC code(s).

=== 1987

The following attributes should be set:

* `:classification:` to set the UDC code(s).

=== 1972

The following attributes should be set:

* `:classification:` to set the UDC code(s).

=== 1951

The first available published ISO format.

The following attributes should be set:

* `:classification:` to set the UDC code(s).


== Lists

=== Unordered lists

Unordered lists in Word are rendered with em-dashes instead of bullets, as
preferred by ISO/CS.

=== Ordered lists

Ordered list numbering enforces the ISO/IEC DIR 2 labelling convention as a default:
a) 1) i) A) I).
However, the style attribute is respected in ordered lists
if provided [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.7.5]:

[source,adoc]
----
[arabic]
. A
. B
[lowerroman]
.. C
.. D
----

The `start` attribute is supported in ISO by Metanorma, but not by IEC or
BSI [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.1.2].

The `start` attribute behaves as described below:

* PDF and HTML respect the `start` attribute at all stages;

* For Word output:

** The `start` attribute will be *ignored* for stages between `00` and `30`,
because Word output for those stages uses the "`ISO Simple Template`", which
involves autonumbering of lists. Metanorma does not yet support `start` in Word
for autonumbered lists.

** The `start` attribute will *work* from stages `40` onward,
as Work output for those stages uses the "`ISO Edited DIS Template`",
which insert explicit numbers in lists, and do not rely on Word autonumbering.


== Admonitions

Admonitions can be applied to:

* Document elements, by adding the block anywhere in the document;

* To the document as a whole, by adding the block to before the first numbered
clause.

Metanorma natively supports the ISO admonitions
"`Caution`", "`Warning`", and "`Important`" through the
admonition syntax using the corresponding type names.

NOTE: These message types are referenced in ISO/IEC DIR 2 from
https://www.iso.org/standard/53940.html[ISO/IEC Guide 51] and
https://www.iso.org/standard/3726.html[ISO 78-2].

* A "`Caution`" message can be specified using `CAUTION:` or `[CAUTION]`.
+
[example]
.Example of specifying Caution messages
======
[source,adoc]
----
CAUTION: This is a single-block caution.

[CAUTION]
====
This is a caution

in multiple blocks.
====
----
======

* A "`Warning`" message can be specified using `WARNING:` or `[WARNING]`.
+
[example]
.Example of specifying Warning messages
======
[source,adoc]
----
WARNING: This is a warning.

[WARNING]
====
This is a warning too,

in multiple blocks.
====
----
======

If the admonitions "`Danger`" and "`Safety Precaution`" are needed, they should
be indicated through a `type` attribute, which will override the admonition type
appearing.

[example]
.Example of specifying Danger and Safety Precaution messages
======
[source,asciidoc]
--
[type=Danger]
CAUTION: This is a single-block danger.

[WARNING,type=Safety Precaution]
====
This is a safety precaution

spanning multiple-blocks.
====
--
======

== Notes
=== Units statements
ISO standards, and standards that inherit formatting from them (IEC, BSI),
can have unit statements on their figures and tables, indicating the unit of
measurement used in the tabulated data. Unit statements are entered as
`[NOTE,type=units]`, and are rendered in the top-right corner of the figure or
table [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.3.6].

[source,adoc]
----

== Editorial notes

Editorial notes can be added to an ISO document, to differentiate feedback from
ISO editors to the readers of a circulated draft, from feedback to the authors
or editors of a
draft [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.1.2].

The editorial note in ISO documents is meant to represent the `zzHelp` style
as known to ISO editors, meant to represent notes to the editors.

Editorial notes are encoded as the `EDITOR` admonition, which can be used
in a single-line encoding or in a block syntax.

[source,asciidoc]
----
EDITOR: {text}
----

Where:

* `{text}` is the contents of the editorial note.


[example]
.Example of specifying editorial notes
======
[source,asciidoc]
--
EDITOR: This is an editorial note.

[EDITOR]
====
So is this.
====

[EDITOR]
And this as well.
--

Renders into:

.Example rendering of editorial notes
image::/assets/author/iso/editorial_notes.png[]
======


[NOTE]
--
`[EDITOR]` is an alias for the admonition `[IMPORTANT,type=editorial]`.
Hence, the following markup is also valid:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[IMPORTANT,type=editorial]
This is an editorial note, too.
----
--

== Cross-references

Custom cross-references should not be used in ISO standards,
either for an external reference, or for a section of the current document:
ISO/IEC DIR 2 requires any cross-references to be transparent in text.

For example, a cross-reference to the anchor such as:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[tabular]]
--

on Clause 5 should be given as just:

[source,asciidoc]
--
<<tabular>>
--

...and custom text will be automatically rendered as `Clause 5`.

ISO clause references will suppress the word "Clause" before a subclause
reference, following ISO/IEC DIR 2: `<``<ISO24333,clause=5>``>` will be rendered
as _ISO 24333, Clause 5_, but `<``<ISO7301,clause=3.1>``>` will be rendered as
_ISO 7301, 3.1_.


== Terms and definitions

NOTE: This subsection supplements
link:/author/topics/document-format/section-terms[Terms and definitions] in
general Metanorma documentation.

=== Terminological entry numbering

==== General

Terminology presented in ISO documents adhere to ISO 10241-1. ISO 10241-1, 6.1
details the organization of numbering terminological entries, which could be
one of:

* systematic order (also called "`nested terms`"); or
* mixed order (also called "`grouped terms`").


==== Systematic order

===== General

In systematic order, the entry numbers are "serial numbers reflecting
the position of the respective concept within a concept system".

[example]
.Example of clause structure with systematic order (ISO 10241-1)
====
3.1 Terminological entry at first level of concept system. +
3.2 Terminological entry at first level of concept system. +
3.2.1 Terminological entry at second level of concept system. +
3.2.2 Terminological entry at second level of concept system. +
3.2.2.1 Terminological entry at third level of concept system. +
3.3 Terminological entry at first level of concept system.
====

In this arrangement, terms are nested within other terms in numbering.

[example]
====
.Encoding terms in systematic order
[source,asciidoc]

== Terms and definitions

=== Term 1
Definition 1

==== Term 1.1
Definition 1.1, a sub-concept of Term 1

==== Term 1.2
Definition 1.2, a sub-concept of Term 1

=== Term 2
Definition 2

==== Term 2.1
Definition 2.1, a sub-concept of Term 2
--
====

===== Encoding parent terms without definitions

If a parent term clause (a term clause that contains terms below) is not
given a definition, the `[.term]` attribute needs to be applied to indicate
that the parent term is a "term" instead of a "mixed-order grouping".

[example]
====
.Encoding terms in systematic order when a parent term definition is missing
[source,asciidoc]
--
== Terms and definitions

[.term]
=== Term 1 (missing definition)

==== Term 1.1
Definition 1.1, a sub-concept of Term 1

==== Term 1.2
Definition 1.2, a sub-concept of Term 1

[.term]
=== Parent Term 2

==== Term 2.1
Definition 3, a sub-concept of Term 2
--
====



==== Mixed order

===== General

In mixed order,

* entry numbers of divisions are "serial numbers reflecting the structure of
  the concept system"
* entry numbers of terminological entries within the divisions are "serial
  numbers reflecting the order of preference"

[example]
.Example of clause structure with mixed order (ISO 10241-1)
====
3.1 Division at first level of concept system. +
3.2 Division at first level of concept system. +
3.2.1 Terminological entry in the order of preference. +
3.2.2 Terminological entry in the order of preference. +
3.2 Division at first level of concept system. +
3.2.1 Division at second level of concept system. +
3.2.1.1 Terminological entry in the order of preference.
====

This arrangement counts terminal subclauses within a "`Terms and definitions`"
clause as terms, and all other intermediate clauses as term groupings.

[example]
.Encoding terms in mixed order with groupings
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
== Terms and definitions

=== Term grouping 1 (subclause 1)

==== Term A
Definition A

==== Term B
Definition B

=== Term grouping 2 (subclause 2)

==== Term C
Definition C
--
====

NOTE: If there is any text in a term grouping, Metanorma is going to assume that
the grouping was intended as a systematic term.


===== Declared term groupings

The role `[.grouping]` explicitly declares a clause as a term grouping,
and not a term. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.3.4].
It is used to enforce mixed order divisions of terms.

[source,asciidoc]
.Encoding terms in mixed order with declared groupings
--
== Terms and definitions

[.grouping]
=== Term grouping 1
Paragraph 1

==== Term A
Definition A

==== Term B
Definition B

[.grouping]
=== Term grouping 2
Paragraph 2

==== Term C
Definition C
--

=== Combined terms and definitions

The title of a top-level "`Terms and definitions`" clause is populated
automatically, overriding the title provided by the user.

If it contains a "`Symbols`" and "`Abbreviated terms`" subclause, it is titled
_"`Terms, definitions, symbols and abbreviated terms`"_, otherwise it is titled
_"`Terms and definitions`"_.

The "`Symbols`" and "`Abbreviated terms`" subclauses are also titled;
other subclauses of "`Terms and definitions`" clauses are not.

In summary, allowed titles for the top-level "`Terms and definitions`" clause
(Clause 3) include:

* "`Terms and definitions`"
* "`Terms, definitions and symbols`"
* "`Terms, definitions and abbreviated terms`"
* "`Terms, definitions, symbols and abbreviated terms`"

=== Concept mentions

Metanorma supports intelligent terms referencing in term definitions.

In ISO deliverables, if a term definition contains a term that is defined in the
current document, this term needs to be put in italics with a cross-reference
for that term supplied between parenthesis immediately after.

EXAMPLE (ISO/IEC Directives Part 2 (2020), 16.5.10):
____
part of a terminological data collection which contains the
_terminological data_ (3.1.3) related to one _concept_ (3.2.1)
____

This is done in Metanorma by using citation of terms, on which see
link:/author/topics/document-format/section-terms#citeterms[Referencing concepts] [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v1.8.6].

So the foregoing instance would be automatically generated through:

[source,adoc]
----
part of a terminological data collection which contains the
{{terminological data}} related to one {{concept}}
----

assuming the terms are defined as the text "`terminological data`" and
"`concept`", or

[source,adoc]
----
part of a terminological data collection which contains the
{{terminology data,terminological data}}
related to one {{conceptual notion,concept}}
----

if say the terms are defined with different wording.

Metanorma imposes the default rendering of term citations following the
https://www.iso.org/ISO-house-style.html[ISO house style]: [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v1.8.7]

* The first mention of a term in the "`Terms and definitions`" clause is
  italicised with a following bracketed cross-reference.
+
[example]
"_concept_ (3.2.1)"

* Subsequent mentions of that term in the "`Terms and definitions`" clause are
  in plaintext, with no following bracketed cross-reference.
+
[example]
"concept"

* Other mentions of the term in the document are in also plaintext, with
  no following bracketed cross-reference.
+
[example]
"concept"


=== Vocabulary documents

==== General

The "`vocabulary`" document type is defined in the
https://www.iso.org/ISO-house-style.html[ISO house style]
and title requirements defined in the ISO/IEC Directives, Part 2, 2018, 11.5.2.

A vocabulary document differs from a normal ISO deliverable because it allows
certain exceptions, but also restricts the type of content allowed in the
deliverable.

According to the https://www.iso.org/ISO-house-style.html[ISO House Style]:
____
A vocabulary is the source document for the terms and definitions of
a committee or subject. It is not a collection of terms used in the
documents of a committee. Therefore, it does not:

* state that it is a collection of terms;

* list the documents that use its terminological entries;

* include documents from its committee as "SOURCE".

* It can include documents from another committee as "SOURCE".

A vocabulary is the only ISO document that can have terminological
entries in clauses other than Clause 3. If terminological entries
are given in other clauses, use a clause title starting
"`Terms related to`". Terminological entries are never included in annexes.
____

==== Setting a vocabulary document

A vocabulary document is specified by setting the document header of
`:docsubtype:` to the value `vocabulary`.

[example]
.Example of setting ISO 8000-2 as a vocabulary document
====
[source,adoc]
----
= ISO 8000-2
:docsubtype: vocabulary
----
====

==== Using terminological entries outside Clause 3

Terminological entries are permitted outside of Clause 3 in vocabulary
documents [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v1.8.3].

Such clauses need to be indicated with the `heading` attribute set to
`terms and definitions`.

[example]
.Using first level clauses for terminology entries in vocabulary documents
====
[source,adoc]
----
:docsubtype: vocabulary
...

[heading=terms and definitions]
== Terms related to comedy theatre
...

[heading=terms and definitions]
== Terms related to fantasy theatre
...
----
====

==== Handling Symbols and Abbreviated terms

Content for "`Symbols`" and "`Abbreviated terms`" are not allowed in the main
content body of vocabulary documents.

NOTE: Information in this clause was provided directly by the ISO/CS Editing
team. It is not explicitly documented in the ISO House Style reference.

There are only two ways of handling symbols and abbreviated terms in a
vocabulary document:

. Included in term entries as preferred or admitted terms. This is the preferred
manner by ISO/CS.

. Listed in an annex named "`Symbols and abbreviated terms`". This is an
accepted practice by ISO/CS.

[example]
.Providing symbols and abbreviated terms as an annex in a vocabulary document
====
[source,adoc]
----
:docsubtype: vocabulary
...

== Terms related to requirements
=== abstract test suite
alt:[ATS]

collection of abstract conformance tests of which passing indicates compliance
to the associated conformance class
----
====


[example]
.Providing symbols and abbreviated terms as an annex in a vocabulary document
====
[source,adoc]
----
:docsubtype: vocabulary
...

[appendix]
== Symbols and abbreviated terms
ATS:: abstract test suite
----
====

== Sections

In the document scheme used by ISO between 1987 and 1989, clauses were organised
into higher-level numbered sections. In order to realise this formatting, use
`type=section` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.7.5], and
`heading=` to indicate the special clause types for subclauses of sections:

[source,adoc]
----
[type=section]
== General

[heading=scope]
=== Scope

[bibliography,heading=normative references]
=== Normative references

[heading=terms and definitions]
=== Terms and definitions
----

== Annexes and appendices

In ISO, Appendixes to annexes can occur, although they are not
mentioned in ISO/IEC DIR 2; ISO/IEC DIR 1 features them. They are
marked up as immediate subsections of annexes, and must be tagged
with an option attribute of `appendix`:

[source,adoc]
--
[appendix]
== Annex A
Text

[%appendix]
=== Appendix 1
Text
--

== Bibliographies

[[note_general_doc_ref_bib]]
NOTE: This subsection supplements link:/author/topics/document-format/bibliography[References & Bibliography] in general Metanorma documentation.

All references under Normative References are expected to have such a standard document identifier. For example:

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[ricepotentialmilling,ISO 6646]]], _Rice -- Determination of the potential milling yield from paddy and from husked rice_
* [[[ISOGuide73, ISO Guide 73:2009]]], _Risk management -- Vocabulary_
--

[subs="quotes"]
ISO 6646 in this example would be cited from elsewhere in the document through cross-references to the `ricepotentialmilling` identifier; e.g. `<< ricepotentialmilling>>` (which will be rendered as `ISO 6646`), `<<``ricepotentialmilling, section 5``>>` (which will be rendered as `ISO 6646, Section 5`), `<<``ricepotentialmilling,section 5: the foregoing discussion``>>` (which will be tagged in the XML representation as Section 5 of ISO 6646, but will be displayed as `the foregoing discussion`.)

ISO treats dated and undated references as separate (an undated reference is taken to
refer to the latest published edition of that reference.) if reference is to be made to
both an undated and a dated version of an ISO reference, these need to be explicitly listed as
separate references.


[TIP]
====
If an ISO reference is in preparation, ISO/IEC DIR 2 dictates that details of the reference status be given as a footnote. In Asciidoc, this is done by giving the date as a double dash, and following the bibliographic anchor with a footnote macro:

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[ISO16634,ISO 16634:--]]] footnote:[Under preparation. (Stage at the time of publication ISO/DIS 16634)], _Cereals, pulses, milled cereal products, oilseeds and animal feeding stuffs -- Determination of the total nitrogen content by combustion according to the Dumas principle and calculation of the crude protein content_
--

If an ISO reference includes all parts of the standard, that is indicated by appending `(all parts)` after the reference anchor:

[source,asciidoc]
--
* [[[ISO16634,ISO 16634 (all parts)]]] _Cereals, pulses, milled cereal products, oilseeds and animal feeding stuffs -- Determination of the total nitrogen content by combustion according to the Dumas principle and calculation of the crude protein content_
--
====

In informative references, references to standards documents are still given with the same format of bibliographic anchor, and they are cited by their document identifier -- although they are displayed with an incrementing reference number in brackets, for consistency with any bibliographic entries that are not standards documents. ISO references appear before non-ISO references. So

[source,asciidoc]
--
[bibliography]
== Bibliography

* [[[ISO3696,ISO 3696]]], _Water for analytical laboratory use -- Specification and test methods_
...
* [[[ref11,11]]] Nitrogen-ammonia-protein modified Kjeldahl method -- Titanium oxide and copper sulfate catalyst. _Official Methods and Recommended Practices of the AOCS_ (ed. Firestone, D.E.), AOCS Official Method Ba Ai 4-91, 1997, AOCS Press, Champaign, IL
--

is displayed as:

[quote]
____
*Bibliography*

[1] ISO 3696, _Water for analytical laboratory use -- Specification and test methods_
...
[11] Nitrogen-ammonia-protein modified Kjeldahl method -- Titanium oxide and copper sulfate catalyst. _Official Methods and Recommended Practices of the AOCS_ (ed. Firestone, D.E.), AOCS Official Method Ba Ai 4-91, 1997, AOCS Press, Champaign, IL
____

The entries in the Bibliography are reordered (and, for numerical references, renumbered) according to the following criteria:

* Document class (as defined in the ISO sample Rice document): standard which ISO has published or co-published; standard which IEC has published or co-published; other standards; other documents.
** Standards are identified by the use of a code for the document identifier, as opposed to a number.
* Document identifier type (as a proxy for the standards setting body)
* Document number (the numeric portion of the standards identifier, sorted numerically)
* Full document identifier
* Document title

The bracketed reference numbers are expected to be correct and in order (accounting for the fact that references to standards will end up numbered): they are not overridden in rendering.


== Amendments and technical corrigenda

Amendments and technical corrigenda [added in https://github.com/metanorma/isodoc/releases/tag/v1.3.25]
have the following particularities in their markup.

=== Dates

Amendments and technical corrigenda bear two dates in their identifiers: the date of the source document,
and the date of the update. The latter date is given as the `:copyright-year:` attribute (and may be given
in more detail as the `:updated-date:` attribute. The former date is given as the `:created-date:` attribute;
if it is missing, the `:copyright-year:` is used instead.

=== Related documents

The `:edition:` attribute applies to the source document, not to the amendment.

The `:updates:` attribute must be used, to give the identifier of the source document, including the date.
If this is a corrigendum to an addendum, the source identifier must be that of the Addendum.

=== Clauses

There are no special clauses: clauses describe the location at which changes are applied. So
`== Terms and definitions` does not introduce a Terms section: it describes the changes to be applied
to the Terms section of the existing document. For the same reason, there are no annexes or
distinct bibliographies.

Clauses are only expected to be one level deep.

The clauses in amendments and technical corrigenda are instances of the
change clauses described in
link:/author/topics/document-format/changes[Machine-readable changes].

[source,adoc]
----
[change=delete,locality="clause=introduction,paragraph=4-7"]
== Introduction
----

=== Form

The document takes the form of clauses describing what is to be amended; the amendments themselves are quoted.

Because the quoted material are snippets with little context, auto-numbering will not yield sensible results,
and neither will cross-referencing autonumbered blocks or clauses. For that reason, amendments and technical corrigenda
must not use cross-referencing, and any auto-numbering is suppressed. Users will have to include explicit
numbering in any snippets of text (as they already do), and mock up clause titles by using boldface
(since clause titles will be quoted, and thus not recognised as such).


[[numeral-formats]]
== Numeral formats

In ISO and IEC, by default, the decimal marker used is the comma, as described

[quote,ISO/IEC Directives Part 2 9.1]
The decimal sign shall be a comma on the line in all language versions.

And digits are also to be grouped into threes:

[quote]
Each group of three digits shall be separated by a small space from the
preceding digits, counting from the decimal sign. This also applies to digits
following the decimal sign.

[example]
.Rendering numbers using `stem` encoding in an ISO or IEC document
The encoding of `stem&#x200c;:[60007.12345]` in an ISO or IEC document in any language
is displayed as _60 007,123 45_.

[example]
.Rendering numbers using `stem` encoding in an ISO or IEC document without treatment on the hanging digit
The encoding of `stem&#x200c;:[2345.6789]` in an ISO or IEC document in any language
is displayed as _2 345,678 9_.
