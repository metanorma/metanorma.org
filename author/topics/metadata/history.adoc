= Revision history

== General

Revision history (also "document history") is a critical aspect of
standardization documents, providing a transparent record of the evolution and
amendments made over time.

Metanorma allows for semantic encoding of revision history that is embedded in
the resulting Metanorma Semantic XML output.

The revision history serves several essential functions:

. **Traceability**: It allows stakeholders to track changes and understand how a
document has evolved.

. **Accountability**: Provides a clear record of who made specific changes and
when they were made.

. **Regulatory compliance**: Ensures that the document complies with relevant
standards and updates.

. **Knowledge management**: Facilitates the transfer of knowledge by maintaining
a historical record of document modifications.

. **Quality assurance**: Helps in reviewing and maintaining the quality and
accuracy of documents over time.


== Encoding semantics

Metanorma differs from common publishing processes as it compiles a standard
into semantic information models, which means that the meaning of information is
preserved, instead of the presentation of information.

Metanorma provides a uniform way of encoding revision history across
all flavors.

The benefits of encoding revision history this way are:

Machine-readability::
The revision history is encoded as structured information that can be easily
processed by software, enabling automated analysis and integration.

Consistency::
A uniform format for preserving history across different standards and
organizations minimizes inconsistencies for the author.

Efficiency::
Streamlines the process of updating and managing revision history.

Interoperability::
Facilitates the sharing and reuse of revision history data across different
systems and platforms.


== How it works

Metanorma stores such history in the Metanorma Semantic XML that can be
presented in any manner required by the SDO.

This information is then rendered in the document, possibly in the preface or in
an annex, commonly as a list or a table, depending on the Metanorma flavor.

This structured approach ensures that document history is both human-readable
and machine-readable, enhancing the overall utility and accessibility of the
documents.


== Simple history

Simple revision history, such as bibliographic dates can be encoded using
document attributes.

These include dates like the publication date or the obsoleted date. For further
details, refer to
link:/author/ref/document-attributes/#timestamps[`:*-date:`] attributes.

Certain flavours of Metanorma allow the identifier of a prior version of the
document to be given under `:updated-by:`.


[[detailed-history]]
== Detailed history

=== General

Some SDOs require detailed revision history to be specified.

Metanorma allows for the encoding of "changes", in which a "series of changes"
result in a revision history.

The following types of changes can be encoded:

Bibliographic changes::
Bibliographic changes are encoded using the https://www.relaton.org/specs[Relaton model].

Content changes::
Content changes are encoded using
link:/author/topics/inline_markup/changes[machine-readable content changes].

=== Syntax

In Metanorma, revision changes are encoded using the "revision history YAML"
format.

The relevant revision history YAML is encoded inside a special clause called the
link:/author/topics/sections/extension-container/[`metanorma-extension` clause],
which in turn houses the YAML as a source block under its `document history`
subclause.
 [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.8.0].

The syntax is represented as follows:

[source,adoc]
--
[.preface]
= metanorma-extension

== document history

[source,yaml]
----
# Revision history YAML content

=== Revision history YAML

Revision history YAML adopts certain elements from
https://www.relaton.org/specs/relaton-yaml/[Relaton YAML].

The YAML structure is as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
---
- date: # Relaton YAML object
  # ...
- date: # Relaton YAML object
  # ...
----

The different versions of the document are specified as an array of
bibliographic record objects. Each version is described in Relaton YAML.

Each bibliographic record object represents a version of the document that has a
relation to the current document:

* By default, the version described is related to the current document through
the `updatedBy` relation.
+
Different types of relation can be specified through the attribute `relation.type`,
with valid values from https://www.relaton.org/model/relations/[Relaton document relations].
+
Valid values are:

`updatedBy`::: (default) The described version is updated by the current
document.

`draftOf`::: The described document is an unpublished draft of the current
document.

`merges`::: The described document was merged into the current document.

`splits`::: The described document was split into a number of documents,
including the current document.

Contributors of the new version are encoded under the Relaton YAML `contributor`
key.

`contributor`::
Individuals or organizations responsible for the change. Each specified as
an https://www.relaton.org/model/creator/[Relaton YAML creator] object.
+
.Change enacted by an organization
[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
- date: ...
  # ...
  contributor:
  - organization:
      name: S-102PT
----
====
+
.Change enacted by an individual
[example]
====

Content changes made in the given version of the document are presented as an
array of change objects under the Relaton YAML object.

=== Change objects

Document flavours may impose their own requirements on which fields are
mandatory inside the change object.

The change object is represented by the content of the `amend` key under each
bibliographic record object.

The `amend` object accepts the following keys:

`description`::
Description of the change in Metanorma AsciiDoc format. This content can span
multiple blocks of text, and contain AsciiDoc formatting such as lists and
tables.
+
NOTE: For the ease of encoding blocks of AsciiDoc content, use the YAML literal
style: `description: |`.
+
.Change description in one line
[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
amend:
- description: Approved edition of S-102
----
====
+
.Change description in multiple lines of AsciiDoc
[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
amend:
- description: |
    Updated clause 4.0 and 12.0.

    Populated clause 9.0.
----
====

`classification`::
A list of tag/value pairs used to classify the change, which can be used for
filtering in the rendering of the document history. The values of the tag/value
pairs are unrestricted.
+
.Classification values are free-form
[example]
====
Classifications possible include change severities (Minor, Major), change scope
(the SDO it relates to), change type (editorial, content).

[source,yaml]
----
amend:
- # ...
  classification:
  - tag: severity
    value: major
  - tag: type
    value: editorial
----
====

`location`::
Locations where the changes occur, specified as a list of Metanorma document
notations, using the
link:/author/topics/inline_markup/citations#locality-types[Metanorma locality notation],
as with bibliographic cross-references.
+
Valid values are listed at the
link:/author/topics/inline_markup/citations#locality-types[Metanorma locality notation] page.
+
.The changes affected the whole document, using the `whole` locality.
[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
amend:
- # ...
  location:
  - whole
----
====
+
.The changes affected clauses 4, 9.1 and 12.2.
[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
amend:
- # ...
  location:
  - clause=4
  - clause=9.1
  - clause=12.2
----
====
+
.The changes affected Annex B.
[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
amend:
- # ...
  location:
  - annex=B
----
====

`change`::
The type of change (`add`, `modify`, `delete`, `replace`). Defaults to `modify`.
+
.The changes modified Clause 3, as the `modify` value is default.
[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
amend:
- # ...
  location:
  - clause=3
----
====
+
.The changes deleted Clause 12.
[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
amend:
- # ...
  change: delete
  location:
  - clause=12
----
====
+
.The changes added Annex N.
[example]
====
[source,yaml]
----
amend:
- # ...
  change: add
  location:
  - annex=N
----
