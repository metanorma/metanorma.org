// tag::tutorial[]

There can be many reasons why you can't compile a Metanorma AsciiDoc document
into the final output, but you can easily fix them when you are familiar with
typical errors.

Metanorma tells you what's wrong in the terminal while it is building the
document. The errors are also stored in an Error file `.err` in the same
directory where your original document is stored, so you can debug them later.

== How to troubleshoot a document

The best way to troubleshoot a document is to break up the content in several
parts to narrow down the location of the error.

Regardless of troubleshooting, it is a good practice to divide a document into
sections. You can then compile each section separately, or compile several of
them in order to locate the error easier.

For example, if you assume there could be some error in Foreword section and
want to exclude it from being rendered, you can easily comment out the section.

.Example for a modular document setup
[source,adoc]
----
 Header with metadata...

 // include::sections/00-foreword.adoc[]

 include::sections/01-introduction.adoc[]
 include::sections/02-scope.adoc[]

 ...
----

=== Where to start troubleshooting?

* *If the document did not compile:*

** If Metanorma did not generate any visual output, you need to work with the
errors in the terminal.

** If execution has aborted before the XML content could be finalised, the XML
file is still output to disk, suffixed with `.xml.abort` rather than `.xml`, and
you can use it to make sense of error messages.

* *If the document did compile and generated visual output:*

** Have a look at the compiled output: Are there missing sections? Is the
formatting different than what you expected? Sometimes you can catch errors by
looking at the rendered document. After that, have a look at the errors on the
terminal to pinpoint where things went wrong.

// end::tutorial[]
The following sections discuss common errors and how to fix them.

== The document won't build - Compilation errors

Compilation failures can happen due to installation or markup errors.

Hopefully, the compilation message will provide us with a clear insight of the
cause of the failure. The first error line usually tells us the cause of the
failure.

Before looking at installation or markup errors, make sure you are running the
build command in the place where your document is placed.

.Example for a failed build because of the wrong location
[source,shell]
----
my-standard $ metanorma document.adoc <1>
Error: Specified input file 'document.adoc' does not exist.

sources $ metanorma document.adoc <2>
----
<1> When we try to run Metanorma in the place that doesn't contain the actual document, it says that the document doesn't exist.
<2> Go to the folder that contains the document and run the build command again.

=== Installation errors

Metanorma uses Ruby gems to manage the stack of Metanorma software. For example,
the `metanorma-iso` gem processes ISO standards.

To manage dependencies, Metanorma uses the tool https://bundler.io/v1.12/[Bundler].

To successfully compile a document, you need to install all gems Metanorma uses
and make sure they are up-to-date. Normally, all relevant gems are installed if
you followed the link:/install/[Installation guide].

To *install* all relevant gems:

. Go to root folder of the directory in which your Metanorma project sits.
+
TIP: You can move into another directory using the "change directory" command (`cd`).

. Run `bundle install`. Bundler fetches and installs the missing gems.

To *update* outdated gems run `bundle-update` in your project directory.

// tag::no-compile-markup[]

=== Markup errors

Metanorma can't compile a document when required information is missing or there
are markup errors.

==== Header lacks required metadata

Metanorma can't compile documents when the core metadata of a document are
missing or incomplete. Metanorma will not render a document if one or more
attributes are missing or contain unknown values:

* Type of flavor `:mn-document-class:`, for example `iso`, `ietf`, `un`, etc.
+
If the document flavor isn't specified in the header, it needs to be specified
in the build command, or else the compilation will fail.

* Document type `:doctype:`, for example `international standard`
+
If the document type isn't specified in the header, it needs to be specified in
the build command, or else the compilation will fail.

* Metadata specific to your organization. Check the link:/flavors/[flavor
documentation] to make sure you've entered the metadata correctly.

==== A single double quotation mark inside of a stem block

Double quotation marks are used in stem blocks to denote normal text, e.g.:
`\stem:["normal text"]`

An odd number of double quotation marks inside a stem block will provoke a
compilation error.


.Example of a compilation error due to a single double quotation mark inside of a stem block
[example]
====
`\stem:["normal text""]` leads to the following compilation error:

[source]
----
...
  from C:/tools/ruby25/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0/gems/metanorma-cli-1.4.6/exe/metanorma:20:in `<top (required)>'
  from C:/tools/ruby25/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0/bin/metanorma:23:in `load'
  from C:/tools/ruby25/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0/bin/metanorma:23:in `<main>'
parsing: "normal text""
undefined method `[]' for nil:NilClass
----
====

==== An external file is not found

Metanorma can't compile a document when a reference to an external file cannot
be found (i.e., an image or any other type of file). The error message will be
explicit on which file.

You can solve the problem by checking the specified location of the file.

==== Two or more cross-references have the same anchor

If two or more cross-references have the same anchor, the document won't build
and the error message will be clear on the reason.

.Example of the same anchor name
[source,asciidoc]
----
[[anchor1]]
== Section 1
...

[[anchor1]]
== Section 2
...
----

To solve this problem, rename the anchor. Check your document against any
references for the anchor that you changed and update them.

// end::no-compile-markup[]

== The document builds, but looks odd

// tag::rendering-errors[]

=== Rendering errors

The main cause for rendering errors are markup errors which can lead to
unexpected rendering results.

Some issues can be:

==== Title page is missing information

If your title page is missing completely, or only shows parts, check the
document attributes in the header. If metadata, like the title, is missing, the
document will be rendered faulty.

==== Document starts to look odd from one point onwards

AsciiDoc requires block delimiters for some block types, such as code samples
and tables. The block delimiter consists of a minimum of four characters. If the
number or type of block delimiters don't match, the compiler doesn't know where
a block begins/ends.

Look for the beginning of the issue, go to the markup, and check out the
delimiting characters of the blocks.

.Examples of faulty blocks
[source,asciidoc]
----
[source,asciidoc]
=== <1>
image::../assets/image.png[]
===

|== <2>
|Name of Column 1
|Name of Column 2

|Cell in column 1, row 1
|Cell in column 2, row 1

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2
|--- <3>
----
<1> The author wanted to demonstrate how to insert an image using AsciiDoc markup. However, the compiler will insert the image (if it exists) because of the missing `=`.
<2> The block delimiter is only three characters long, so the compiler will not render the table.
<3> `|---` This delimiter is invalid.


==== Paragraphs look like code blocks

If you ever see a paragraph rendered inside of a source block, you probably have
left a white space at its beginning. Paragraphs cannot begin with any white
space or they will be erroneously rendered as source blocks.

==== Missing images

If there are images missing, make sure that:

* The syntax is correct. Make sure you set the square brackets at the end, even
if you don't want to use any attributes for the image.
+
[source,adoc]
----
image::path/file.jpg[]
----

* The path and the file extension are correct. If you used the
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/images-directory/[`:imagesdir:` attribute]
to set the image path, check if the path is correct.

// end::rendering-errors[]

==== Index term is showing up multiple times

If an index term that only should appear once, appears several times, check the
parentheses used in the index entries for this term.

The syntax for index entries looks like this:

[source,adoc]
----
Visible index terms: `((Level 1 index term))`

Hidden index terms: `(((Level 1 index term, Level 2 index term, Level 3 index term)))`
----


=== Cross-reference errors

==== Incorrect format of reference anchor

Cross-reference anchors cannot begin with numbers, underscores, hyphens or any
other special characters. If they do, they will not be processed in compilation
and will certainly lead to rendering errors in the section titles. Anchors must
begin with a letter or an underscore and can not contain any special character
other than hyphens and underscores.

.Example for incorrect anchor names
[source,asciidoc]
----
// Examples of incorrect anchors in references

* [[[123anchor1,identifier 1]]], ... // Anchors cannot begin with a number

* [[[_anchor2,identifier 2]]], ... // Anchors cannot begin with underscores or hyphens

* [[[#anchor3,identifier 3]]], ... // Anchors cannot begin with any special character. Just letters.
----

Also make sure to use the same keyword for references. If the compiler finds a
reference without a matching anchor, it will not process the reference.

[source,asciidoc]
----
[[anchor1234]]
<<anchor1432>>

Error message: No label has been processed for ID anchor1432
----

==== A reference auto-fetch failure

When a reference
link:/author/topics/sections/bibliography/#autofetch[auto-fetching] process
fails, compilation failure may happen.

The Metanorma team is constantly searching and solving issues related with the
automatic importation of bibliographic entries.

Instead of waiting for a bugfix, you can apply a quick workaround. You can
disable the automatic look-up of the individual reference by enclosing its
identifier with `nofetch()`.


For example, let's suppose we have an issue with the reference `ITU-R BT.2267-10`.
Its AsciiDoc markup would correspond to:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[bibliography]
== References

* [[[bt2267-10,ITU-R BT.2267-10]]], Report ITU-R BT.2267-10 (2019), _Integrated broadcast-broadband systems._
----

and gives us a compilation failure message of:

[source]
----
...
[relaton-itu] ("ITU-R BT.2267-10") fetching...
C:/tools/ruby25/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0/gems/relaton-bib-1.7.4/lib/relaton_bib/hash_converter.rb:440:in `block in symbolize': undefined method `to_sym' for 404:Integer (NoMethodError)
Did you mean?  to_s
  from C:/tools/ruby25/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0/gems/relaton-bib-1.7.4/lib/relaton_bib/hash_converter.rb:439:in `each'
  from C:/tools/ruby25/lib/ruby/gems/2.5.0/gems/relaton-bib-1.7.4/lib/relaton_bib/hash_converter.rb:439:in `reduce'
...
----

To solve issues with automatic lookup, we can set the `nofetch()` attribute:

.Example of disabled automatic lookup for one bibliographic entry
[source,adoc]
----
[bibliography]
== References

* [[[bt2267-10,nofetch(ITU-R BT.2267-10)]]], Report ITU-R BT.2267-10 (2019), _Integrated broadcast-broadband systems._
----

==== Footnotes are repeated in tables

In AsciiDoc, tables cells are processed as completely separate documents. That
means that table cells are not aware of one another's contents. As a result, if
a footnote is repeated among different cells through named footnotes, the
AsciiDoc parser will not recognise them.

.Example of repeated footnotes in tables
[example]
====
[source]
----
|===
|A footnote:a[ABC] | B footnote:a[]
|===
----

Renders as:

____
[cols="1,1"]
|===
| A^1^ | B^2^
2+a| ^1^ ABC +
^2^
|===
____

=== Errors that are bugs

Metanorma is under continuous development, so it is possible to face an error
that you can not fix because it is a bug. If you need help with a persisting
error or if you found a bug, please create a new issue on Github in your
organization's repository (`metanorma-ORGNAME`), for example `metanorma-iso`.
