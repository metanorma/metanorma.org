= Links and cross-references

// tag::tutorial[]
References are an integral part of standards. The main mechanism for references
are anchors and destinations. There are four types of references:

* Hyperlinks to an external source, for example a link to a website
* Metadata references
* Internal references to a section, image, table, etc.
// * link:/author/topics/sections/entering-bib[Bibliographic entries]

== Hyperlinks

Metanorma AsciiDoc lets you include links to external sources, and sources to
files within the same project.

To reference an *internal* source:

. Use the `link:` command to include a link to a file. The syntax looks like
this: `\link:PATH[]`.

. Add link text in square brackets after the path.
+
.Example of an internal link

----
Download the latest link:downloads/report.pdf[Report]!
----
// end::tutorial[]

// tag::tutorial[]

To reference an *external* source:

. Paste the URL into the document.
. Add link text in square brackets after the URL (optional) `URL[Link text]`.
+

----
http://www.iso.org/[International Organization for Standardization].

*Adding acessibility in URIs*

To add acessibility URIs, use the `,title=...` option in the square brackets.
The option corresponds to HTML's alt text `a@title` attribute.

== Metadata references

Every document contains a set of metadata to describe the document. You can insert a metadata reference by putting the attribute in curly braces `{attribute}`. The reference will be replaced with the value in the rendered output.

:subcommittee-number: 11
:subcommittee: Fasteners with metric external thread

This document was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC {technical-committee-number}, _{technical-committee}_, Subcommittee SC {subcommittee-number}, _{subcommittee}_.
----

== Internal references

To link to an important section, table, figure, formula, or list item in your
document:

. Set an anchor using double square brackets before the content you want to reference: `\[[anchor]]`.
+

.Typical gelatinization curve
image::images/rice_image2.png[Image of the gelatinization curve]
----
+
.Rendered image caption
image::/assets/author/learn/references_img_anchor.jpg[]

. To reference an anchor, type the anchor name like this `\<<anchor>>`.
+

. To set an alternative text other than the anchor text, append the text inside
the brackets using a comma.

// Include in Auto Numbering topic??
== Auto-numbering of references

Metanorma automatically numbers and names references; because they are
autonumbered, they will be renumbered automatically if you insert any new text
of the same type.

Since the markup will be converted into XML, the anchor must follow the
https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/[XML namespace conventions].

Therefore, an anchor name name must not contain:

* colons
* whitespaces
* words starting with numbers

link:/author/basics/xrefs[Deep-dive into cross-references].


== Format-independent links

// *Updating file extension automatically*

Typical links created by the `link` command require the correct file path that
includes the file suffix (e.g. `.html` for HTML documents).

When linking a Metanorma document to another Metanorma document, which can be
rendered into multiple output formats with different suffixes
(such as in HTML, PDF or DOC), the option `update-type=true` can be specified
to achieve format-independent
links [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.9.4].

When the option `update-type=true` is given, the rendered link will provide the
correct file paths dependent on the output format.

The following conditions must be satisfied to use format-independent links:

* The link shall be relative and not absolute
* The link shall not have a file suffix


[example]
.Example of links to other Metanorma documents
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
link:../parent[update-type=true]
link:../child[This is the child document,update-type=true]
----

This will render the following links depending on the output format:

* in HTML, `../parent.html` and `../child.html`
* in PDF, `../parent.pdf` and `../child.pdf`
====

== Hyperlink validation

Hyperlinks are validated and normalized in
Metanorma [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.5.2].

Hyperlinks are treated as IRIs (internationalized resource identifiers, where
non-ASCII Unicode characters are allowed.)

As with normal AsciiDoc, `http(s)` links are assumed by default to be intended
as hyperlinks, and are marked up and rendered as such.

Example hyperlinks are often invalid (e.g. `http://{domain}`), and Metanorma
execution will be aborted if they are found, since they cannot be rendered as
meaningful hyperlinks.

Such links should be escaped by prefixing them with a backslash, which will
result in them being treated as plain text (e.g. `\http://{domain}`.)
