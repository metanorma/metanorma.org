== Citations and localities

=== General

Citations of references in Metanorma are formulated as cross-references.

The anchor cross-referenced is the internal identifier given for the
bibliographic entry.

[example]
.Example of specifying a reference anchor (`ref1` is the anchor)
====
[source,adoc]
----
<<ref1,part=IV,chapter=3,paragraph=12>>
----
====

Metanorma AsciiDoc works in a similar way to typical AsciiDoc: any text in a
cross-reference that follows a comma constitutes custom text for the
cross-reference.

A cross-reference `\<<ISO7301,the foregoing reference>>` will be rendered as
"`the foregoing reference`", and hyperlinked to the `ISO7301` reference.

[[localities]]
=== Localities

==== General

Citations can include details of where in the document the citation is located.

These localities are entered by suffixing the lowercase type of locality, then
an equals sign, then the locality value or range of values.

Multiple instances of locality and reference can be provided, delimited by comma
or colon.

The references cannot contain spaces. Any text following the sequence of
localities will be displayed instead of the localities.

[[locality-types]]
==== Locality types

The following locality types are recognised in Metanorma:

`section`::
a general section

`clause`::
a clause

`part`::
a document part

`paragraph`::
a paragraph

`chapter`::
a chapter

`page`::
a page

`line`::
a line identified by the line number

`table`::
a table

`annex`::
an annex

`figure`::
a figure

`example`::
an example

`note`::
a note

`formula`::
a mathematical formula

`list`::
a list

`time`::
a particular time

`anchor`::
an anchor

`whole`::
whole

`title`::
the title

Except for the locality types of `whole` and `title`, all locality types require
explicit specification of an identifier to make sense.

.Example locality types that are used on their own
[example]
====
* `whole`
* `title`
====

.Example locality types that need to be used with identifiers
[example]
====
* `note 1` (or `note=1`)
* `page 77-99` (or `page="77-79"`)
* `annex A` (or `annex=A`)
* `line 399` (or `line=399`)
====

Locality types not listed here shall be entered using the mechanism described at
<<custom-locality>>.

==== Simple locality

A simple locality is specified with a unique location identifier or free text.

[example]
.Example of referencing locality in Metanorma citations
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
<<ISO7301,clause=3.1-3.4>>

NOTE: This table is based on <<ISO7301,table=1>>.

Sampling shall be carried out in accordance with <<xxx,section="5-3-1,bis">>
----
====

[example]
.Example that renders a reference as free text
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
// renders as: "the foregoing reference"
<<ISO712,the foregoing reference>>
----
====

To refer to the "`whole`" item, or the title within a block, the corresponding keyword is used
(`whole`, `title`), without an argument.

[example]
.Example of referencing with a "whole" locality
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
// renders as: "ISO 712, Whole of text"
<<ISO712,whole>>
----
====


==== Hierarchical locality

A hierarchical location is specified through consecutive narrower localities.

[example]
.Example of referencing a hierarchical locality
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
// renders as "`Part IV, Chapter 3, paragraph 12`"
<<ref1,part=IV,chapter=3,paragraph=12>>
----
====

[example]
.Example that renders the reference with (multiple) hierarchical localities
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
// renders as: "ISO 712, Section 5, Page 8-10"
<<ISO712,section=5, page 8-10>>
----
====

[example]
.Example of referencing locality with additional text
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
// renders as "ISO 712, 5:8-10"
// ("5:8-10" treated as replacement text for all the foregoing)
<<ISO712,section=5, page=8-10: 5:8-10>>
----
====

==== Discontinuous locality

Discontinuous localities can be named by repeating the same locality type.

[example]
.Example of referencing a discontinuous locality
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
// renders as "`page 4, page 7`"
<<ref1,page=4,page=7>>
----
====

Discontinuous localities can also be specified by delimiting sequences of
localities with semicolon [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.24] +

[example]
.Example of referencing discontinuous hierarchical localities
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
// renders as "`Part IV, Chapter 3; Part VI, Chapter 9`"
<<ref1,part=IV,chapter=3;part=VI,chapter=9>>
----
====

==== Complex locality

Complex relations between discontinuous references can be specified by
prefixing conjoining verbs to sequences of localities separated
by semicolon [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.0.4].

This will result in overt connectives between the references, which will be
internationalised.

Conjoining verbs include:

* `and!`
* `or!`
* `from!`
* `to!`

[example]
.Example of referencing a complex locality
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
// renders as: "`Chapters 3 and 7`"
<<chapter=3;and!chapter=7>>
----
====

[example]
.Example of referencing a complex locality that contains a hierarchical locality
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
// renders as: "Part IV, Chapter 3 or Part VI, Chapter 9"
<<ref1,part=IV,chapter=3;or!part=VI,chapter=9>>
----
====

NOTE: This is similar to the behavior in
link:/author/topics/document-format/xrefs/#combined-xrefs[Combination of cross-references].

As with cross-references, more than two references combined by "`and`" should be
marked up with semicolons. internationalization during rendering will take care
of separating the references by colon, and inserting any necessary conjunction
wording ("`and`").

[example]
.Example of referencing multiple references that are complex localities
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
<<ref1,clause=3.2;clause=4.7;clause=4.9;clause=9>>
// or
<<ref1,clause=3.2;and!clause=4.7;and!clause=4.9;and!clause=9>>
----
====

NOTE: If references are joined with semicolons and connectives, but the locality is not supplied
for a cross-reference, it is filled in by referring to the preceding conjoined
cross-reference [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.8.0].
For example, `<<ref1,clause=3.2;and!4.7;to!4.9;and!9>>` is
corrected internally to the more explicit `<<ref1,clause=3.2;and!clause=4.7;to!clause=4.9;and!clause=9>>`.

Trailing text after the sequence of `locality=reference` (or
`locality{space}reference`) is treated as custom text for the cross-reference,
as would occur normally in a typical cross-reference.

The locality can appear in quotations if it contains special characters (like
dashes or commas).

[[custom-locality]]
==== Custom locality

Locality types not listed in <<locality-types>> are entered using the
"custom locality" functionality.

Metanorma accepts a fixed list of locality types in cross-references (see
<<locality-types>>), which is not meant to be exhaustive of all possible
locality types.

[example]
`annex` is recognized as a generic reference to annexes in documents, but it
does not recognize appendixes (instead of annexes), or as distinct from annexes
(as is the case in ISO deliverables).

A custom locality is entered by prefixing the locality type with `locality:`.

A custom locality has the following properties:

* The locality type will be rendered as text preceding the equal sign.

* The locality type shall not contain commas, colons, or space.

* The locality type is meant to be valid for all languages.
+
NOTE: The custom locality `locality:appendix` would be used for both English
and French texts.

* Localization of custom locality types is managed through inclusion in the
internationalization YAML file for that language, which has to be customized
as part of the Metanorma flavor implementation.
+
NOTE: The custom locality `locality:appendix` is realized as French _Appendice_
through configuration in the Metanorma flavor implementation.

[source,asciidoc]
----
<<ISO-IEC_DIR_1_ISO_SUP,annex=SL,locality:appendix=2,clause=3.2>>
----

Renders as:

____
"ISO/IEC DIR 2, Annex SL, Appendix 2, Clause 3.2"
____
====


==== Locality plus custom text

Any text after the bibliographic localities is still treated as custom
cross-reference text.

As with references without localities, the custom cross-reference text is the
only text that is displayed in the document; but the cross-reference still
captures the specific locality of the reference, e.g. for cross-reference
generation.

[example]
.Example of referencing with bibliographic localities with additional custom text
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
<<ISO7301,clause=5,table=1,the foregoing reference>>
----

rendered as:

____
the foregoing reference
____
====

==== Anchor locality

Exceptionally, the `anchor` locality is only used in HTML, to generate
anchor links to other HTML pages [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.4.1].

It is intended for use with bibliographic anchors linking to URLs (`repo:()`, `path:()`):
see link:/author/topics/sections/bibliography/#other-databases[Referencing from a Metanorma collection]
and link:/author/topics/sections/bibliography/#hyperlink-biblio[Referencing from Metanorma or Relaton files].


[example]
.Example of using the `anchor` locality for rendering in HTML output
====
The following input:

[source,asciidoc]
--
<<ISO7301,clause=2,table=1a,page=7-9,anchor=xyz>>

...

* [[[ISO7301,path:(./iso7301.html,ISO 7301)]]]
--

will render in HTML as:

[source,html]
--
<a href="./iso7301.html#xyz">ISO 7301, Clause 2, Table 1a, page 7-9</a>
--
====

==== Case and dropped locality labels

The `capital%`, `lowercase%` and `droploc%` options used for internal
cross-references can also be used as prefixes to localities, modifying how those
localities are
rendered [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.8.9].


[example]
.Example of using `droploc` in a citation locality
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
// renders as "ISO 7301, 2"
<<ISO7301,droploc%clause=2>>
--
====

[example]
.Example of using `lowercase` in a citation locality
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
// renders as "ISO 7301, clause 2"
<<ISO7301,lowercase%clause=2>>
--
====

==== Styled cross-references

As with link:/author/topics/document-format/xrefs#xref-styles[internal cross-references], cross-referenced
citations can have a `style` attribute [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.4.4].
As of this writing, the only values allowed are the types of docidentifier value that can be substituted
for the primary identifier of the reference, for standards documents; those values will need to be looked up in
Relaton (and the Semantic XML of the document). For example, given the citation

[source,xml]
----
<bibitem type="standard" id="bib1">
...
<docidentifier type="ISO" primary="true">ISO/FDIS 17664-1</docidentifier>
<docidentifier type="URN">urn:iso:std:iso-fdis:17664:-1:ed-1:fr</docidentifier>
...
</bibitem>
----

A crossreference `<<bib1>>` will be populated by default with the primary or else the first
`docidentifier` value found, `ISO/FDIS 17664-1`. However, given `<<bib1,style=URN%>>`, the
first `docidentifier` value of type `URN` will be sought instead, and the cross-reference
will be populated by default as `URN urn:iso:std:iso-fdis:17664:-1:ed-1:fr`.


=== Link-only references

A standards document can be cross-referenced in Metanorma without that document
appearing in the document references.

Such cross-reference is treated as equivalent to a cross-reference
to a hidden citation, as documented in link:/author/topics/sections/bibliography[hiding citations].

Link-only references can be added to Metanorma AsciiDoc using the following
command:

[source,adoc]
----
++std-link:[...]++
----

Where the `std-link` command contains the same text as a normal cross-reference
to a standard, including localities and other directives.
There is no need for an explicit bibliographic entry. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.0.4].

The following two examples are equivalent:

[example]
.Link-only reference of ISO 123 using `std-link`
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
std-link:[ISO 123,droploc%clause=3]
----
====

[example]
.Link-only reference of ISO 123 using a hidden citation
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
<<ref1,droploc%clause=3>>

[bibliography]
== Bibliography

* [[[ref1,hidden(ISO 123)]]]
----
====

=== Combination of citations

Simple citations can be combined with connectives, in a similar fashion to cross-references
(link:/author/topics/document-format/xrefs/#combined-xrefs[Combination of cross-references]),
and which will be internationalised as
appropriate [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.2.7].

[example]
.Example of rendering a range of citations
====
The following citation range:

[source,adoc]
----
<<from!context;to!improvement>>
----

is rendered as:

____
From [3] to [7]
