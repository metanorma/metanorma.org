title: Index Terms

NOTE: Metanorma always processes index terms and creates the corresponding XML. However, not all flavors render an Index section. Check out the https://www.metanorma.org/flavors/[flavor documentation] for your SDO to see if it supports indexing.

tag::tutorial[]
Before you define an index term, your document needs a section where the index terms can appear. To create an index, define a level 1 section (==) marked with the style index at the end of your document.

Index entries can consist of up to three levels using a comma to separate the terms. Metanorma provides two options to create an index entry:

* Visible index terms are words within the text that are annotated with an index entry using double parentheses. `\((Level 1 index term))`
* Hidden index terms are index entries that are not visible in the final output and are generated using triple parentheses. `(\((Level 1 index term, Level 2 index term, Level 3 index term)))`. These allow the index to include optional subterms and sub-subterms; they also allow the index term to differ from what actually appears in the text.

Let’s have a look at an example:

[source, AsciiDoc]
----
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite,
held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water,
signifying by divine providence that I, ((Arthur)), <1>
was to carry Excalibur (((Sword, Broadsword, Excalibur))). <2>
----
<1> `\((Arthur))` will be displayed as `Arthur` in the text and carries a first level index entry
<2> `(\((Sword, Broadsword, Excalibur)))` will not appear in the text, but a three level index entry will be generated.

== Index terms

=== General

Metanorma supports index entries with primary, secondary and tertiary
index terms. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.10].

Primary index terms are listed under the first-level index,
the secondary index terms are listed under the primary index terms' sub-index,
and the tertiary index terms are listed under the secondary index term's sub-index.

Index term behavior differs per rendered output format:

* In PDF, indexes are rendered as references to page numbers.
* In HTML and DOC, indexes are rendered as references to the nearest
  labelled block; a note, example, figure, formula etc., if the index
  term is contained within it, or a clause or subclause, otherwise.

Index term links are only rendered in certain flavours, and do not
appear otherwise in DOC, PDF or HTML output.

NOTE: Currently, only the ISO, IETF and BIPM flavours render
index terms.


=== Rendered index term syntax

Metanorma index entries are entered through two different
syntaxes. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.10].

Rendered index term: `+((Term))+`

* Produces the output "`Term`"; and
* Links to the primary index term of the same name, "`Term`".

Hidden index term: `+(((IndexTerm1)))+`,
  `+(((IndexTerm1, IndexTerm2)))+` or
  `+(((IndexTerm1, IndexTerm2, IndexTerm3)))+`

* Produces no output; and
* Links to the primary index term `IndexTerm1`. And if provided, links to
  the secondary nesting, `IndexTerm2` and the tertiary nesting `IndexTerm3`.

EXAMPLE:

[source,asciidoc]
--
The Lady of the Lake, her arm clad in the purest shimmering samite,
held aloft Excalibur from the bosom of the water,
signifying by divine providence that I, ((Arthur)),
was to carry Excalibur (((Sword, Broadsword, Excalibur))).
--


=== Rich-text formatting

Rich-text formatting in index terms is
supported [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.0].

[source,asciidoc]
--
signifying by divine providence that I, ((*Arthur*)),
was to carry Excalibur (((Sword~E~, stem:[sqrt(E)], Excalibur))).
--

NOTE: Formatting of index terms is ignored in IETF rendering.


=== Entry ranges

Metanorma supports index entries that involve ranges [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.0],
using the command `index-range:to[...]`.

The command itself accepts an AsciiDoc index entry, such as
`+((...))+` or `+(((...)))+`.

The index entry range starts at the location of the `index-range`
command, in the same way as the index command it contains; the end of
the range is the element with the anchor `to`, and that is expected
to be provided as a bookmark.

[source,asciidoc]
--
signifying by divine providence that I, index-range:end-range-1[((*Arthur*))],
was to carry Excalibur index-range:end-range-2[(((Sword~A~, stem:[sqrt(2)], Excalibur)))].

...

and so forth.[[end-range-1]]

...

_Sic explicit fabula._[[end-range-2]]
--

The preceding example has a visible index entry for _**Arthur**_,
ranging from the location of `+*Arthur*+` up to `end-range-1`, and
a hidden index entry for _Sword~A~_, ranging from the location of
`+Sword~A~+` up to `end-range-2`.


=== Cross-references

Metanorma also supports "`see`" and "`see also`" cross-references between
index terms [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.6.5],
using the `index` command.

The command takes at least two parameters:

* the primary index term to be cross-referenced;
* the target of the cross-reference;
* optionally, the secondary and tertiary index term to be cross-referenced.
