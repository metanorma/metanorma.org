Metanorma supports extensive inline formatting functionality.
The following formatting macros are available in Metanorma.

== Basic markup

=== General

AsciiDoc allows you to:

* Emphasize words in *bold* using asterisks
* _Italicise_ words with underscores
* Apply `monospace` format using backticks
* Specify superscript and subscript characters (CO~2~, x^4^)

.Example of basic inline markup
====
[source,adoc]
----
*bold*
_italic_
`monospace`
^superscript^
~subscript~
----

Renders as:

*bold*
_italic_
`monospace`
^superscript^
~subscript~
====

// end::text-markup[]

=== Strikethrough

The `strike` command renders text with a middle line strikethrough.

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[strike]#text#
----

Where:

* `text` is the text to be rendered with the strikethrough style

[example]

====
[source,asciidoc]
----
[strike]#strike through text#
----

renders:

====


=== Small caps

The `smallcap` command renders text in small capital letters.

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[smallcap]#text#
----

Where:

* `text` is the text to be rendered in small caps

[example]
.Illustration of small caps text
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
[smallcap]#small caps text#
----

renders:

====

=== Underline

The underline command renders text with an underline. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.2].

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[underline]#text#
----

Where:

* `text` is the text to be underlined

[example]
.Illustration of underlined text
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
[underline]#underline text#
----

renders:

image::/assets/author/topics/inline_formatting/fig-underline.png[Illustration of underlined text in Metanorma]
====

=== Ruby

Ruby annotations in East Asian text are provided [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.7.5]
using the `ruby:{annotation}[{base text}]` macro.

The `ruby` command supports these optional parameters:

* `lang=` for language of annotation
* `script=` for script of annotation
* `type=` for the type of annotation
(`pronunciation` or `annotation`, with `pronunciation` as the default value).

[source,asciidoc]
----
ruby:とうきょう[東京]
ruby:とうきょう[lang=ja,script=Hira,type=pronunciation,東京]
ruby:Tōkyō[type=pronunciation,script=Latn,東京]
ruby:ライバル[type=annotation,親友]
ruby:とう[東] ruby:きょう[京]
ruby:Tō[script=Latn,東]ruby:kyō[script=Latn,京]
----

Metanorma supports "double-sided" Ruby annotations, with annotations both above
and below characters; these are marked up as nested Ruby annotation macros, with
the deeper nested annotation assumed to be the annotation below the characters.

[source,asciidoc]
----
ruby:とう[ruby:tou[東\]] ruby:なん[ruby:nan[南\]] の方角
ruby:たつみ[ruby:とう[東\]{blank}ruby:なん[南\]]
ruby:プロテゴ[ruby:まも[護\]{blank}れ]!
ruby:プロテゴ[れ{blank}ruby:まも[護\]]!
----

As of this writing, double-sided annotations are not supported in Word, and the
nested annotations are realised as bracketed text.



=== Capitalisation

Capitalisation may be applied automatically in the rendering of documents, despite not being present in the source material;
for example, titles and captions may be title-cased or put in all caps. In order to prevent a span of text automatically
having its case changed, use CSS styling to set its CSS text-transform property to "none" [added in https://github.com/metanorma/isodoc/releases/tag/v2.8.5]:

[example]
.Example of a word in a title not to be capitalized
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
:title: [css text-transform:none]#IoT# and content standards

...

=== Approaches to [css text-transform:none]#IoT#
--
====

As shown, such styling extends to document titles as document attributes.

=== Custom character sets

When a https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Private_Use_Areas[private use codepoint]
is used in a document, reflecting an agreement between the document author
and the document renderer, but *not* a standard like Unicode, the custom character set that includes
that codepoint needs to be flagged. So U+F8D0 is the Klingon letter for "a" in the
https://www.evertype.com/standards/csur/[Conscript Unicode Registry], but the Kanji-Katakana hybrid of
訁and コ (equivalent to 講) in the https://www.babelstone.co.uk/Fonts/PUA.html[BabelStone PUA].

In order to flag such a custom interpretation of the codepoint, the interpretation can be named
in a formatting directive, flagged as `custom-charset` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.6.3].
For example:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[custom-charset:conscript]#\\uf8d0#
[custom-charset:babelstone]#\\uf8d0#
----

In order to be rendered, a font implementing that interpretation needs to be indicated as a processing hint
for Metanorma. This is done with the Presentation XML metadata directive
`:presentation-metadata-custom-charset-font: {name of interpretation}:"{name of font}"`, as a document attribute,
giving a comma-delimited list of charset-font pairs.  For instance:

[source,asciidoc]
----
:presentation-metadata-custom-charset-font: conscript:"Code 2000",babelstone:"BabelStone PUA"
:fonts: "Code 2000";"BabelStone PUA"
----

As with link:/author/topics/inline_markup/text_formatting#css[CSS declarations],
any font specified as a custom charset font also needs to be passed to Metanorma
in the `:fonts:` document attribute.


=== Numeric ranges

Numeric ranges, like dates (e.g., _1981&ndash;1995_), make use of
_en dashes_ in between the numbers, usually without any white space around.

At the time writing, there is no AsciiDoc encoding to render en dashes.

In Metanorma, there is a vision of implementing a semantic encoding for
numeric ranges, perhaps an option like `range:[n,m]` or shorthands like `n..m`.

For the time being, the existent workaround for such cases is
the use of entity codes, more specifically:

=== Character substitutions

// tag::char-subs[]

Metanorma AsciiDoc supports
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/subs/replacements/[Asciidoctor-style character substitutions]
as shown in <<table-char-sub>>.

Metanorma AsciiDoc also recognises HTML and XML character references,
and decimal and hexadecimal Unicode code points.

[[table-char-sub]]
.Supported Metanorma AsciiDoc character substitutions

|pass:[<=]   | <= (Unicode 'Leftwards Double Arrow' `U+21D0`)|
|`'`    | Smart single quote, smart apostrophe |
|`"`    | Smart double quote |

|===

NOTE: Replacement of `-` only occurs when placed between two word
characters, between a word character and a line boundary, or flanked
by spaces. Flanking spaces (as in `x -- y`) are rendered as thin
spaces (Unicode 'Thin Space' `U+2009`).

// `--` is rendered as an en-dash (&#8211;), which is not catered for by escapes.

// end::char-subs[]

// end::tutorial[]


[[css]]
=== CSS declarations

The `css` command is used to wrap content with a CSS declaration
(https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSS_Object_Model/CSS_Declaration[MDN])
[added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.1.6].

This feature only applies to HTML output.

NOTE: CSS declarations are also used within the HTML `style` attribute.

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[css {css-directive}]#{styled-text}#
--

Where:

* `{css-directive}` is a CSS declaration

* `{styled-text}` is text where the CSS declaration is to be applied

[example]
.Example of applying a custom CSS declaration to content
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
[css font-family:"Noto Sans JP"]#お好み焼き#

[css font-family:"Noto Sans Canadian Aboriginal"]#ᓀᐦᐃᔭᐍᐏᐣ#
--
====

NOTE: Any font specified in `[css font-family:...]` needs to be passed to
Metanorma for processing by specifying it in the `:fonts:` document attribute.


=== Identifier

The `identifier` command, used to indicate that its contents are an identifier
as semantic markup (and not to be processed as a
hyperlink) [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.1.2].

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
----
identifier:[my-identifier]
----

Where:

* `my-identifier` is the identifier to be encoded.


This functionality is very useful for encoding URIs, which can be virtually
indistinguishable from URLs that can be resolved. URIs very often cannot
be resolved since they are simply namespaced identifiers.

[example]
.Example of rendering a URI using the `identifier` command
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
identifier:[https://schemas.isotc211.org/19115/-1/mdb/1.3]
--

renders:

____
`https&#x200c;://schemas.isotc211.org/19115/-1/mdb/1.3`

====

[example]
.Example of rendering a URN using the `identifier` command
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
identifier:[urn:iso:std:iso:8601:-1:en]
----

renders:

____
`urn:iso:std:iso:8601:-1:en`
____
====


=== Semantic spans

The `span` command is used to introduce semantic markup into
Metanorma text [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.1.6].

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
----
span:category[text]
----

Where:

* `category` is a semantic label for the content given as `text`
* `text` is the textual content

Here, the _text_ is tagged as belonging to _category_.

A semantically-tagged text with `span` is not normally rendered any different to
normal, although the semantic markup introduced can be used to influence
rendering.

NOTE: Only certain Metanorma flavors support enhanced rendering for
semantically-tagged content.


=== Nesting of styles

Character styles can be nested within each other, with both constrained and
unconstrained formatting marks.
