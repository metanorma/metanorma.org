== General

Admonition blocks are typically inserted into the main content of a document
providing guidance or request readers to exercise caution.

== Types of admonitions

Metanorma supports the following admonition types:

NOTE:: Informative guidance.
TIP:: Useful information.
EDITOR:: Editor's notes that will appear in a draft document.
IMPORTANT:: Important information on the application of the document.
WARNING:: Information that includes safety concerns.
CAUTION:: Information that the reader must be aware.
TODO:: Author's or editor's internal notes, not rendered.

The following types of admonitions require an atypical syntax for access:

DANGER:: Information that can lead to safety concerns if not covered.
SAFETY PRECAUTION:: Information that relates to safety precautions.

NOTE: Typical AsciiDoc only supports NOTE, TIP, IMPORTANT, CAUTION and WARNING.

In addition, the following types are recognised by specifying `[type=...]` as a
block attribute on one of the latter four built-in admonition types in block
mode (other than NOTE):

* `statement`: typographically separate statements in mathematics, such as propositions, proofs, or theorems.
* `editorial`: annotation by document editors, intended for all readers of the document and not just its authors.
* `box`: box element, intended as standalone sidebar which can be referenced from within the document.

== Specifying admonitions

There are two ways to declare an admonition: in a single paragraph and as a block.


=== Single paragraph admonitions

Start a new line with the admonition type in all caps and a colon and write your
admonition.

.Example for a single paragraph note
[source,adoc]
----
NOTE: Advice on when to use which admonition type is specified in ANSI Z535.6.
----

WARNING: Single paragraph admonitions  are only guaranteed to be recognised if they are
natively supported by AsciiDoc: NOTE, TIP, IMPORTANT, CAUTION and WARNING. DANGER and
SAFETY PRECAUTION are not recognised as single paragraph admonitions. EDITOR and TODO
are recognised, but only as paragraphs directly under a section header: AsciiDoc limitations
mean that they will not be recognised in other contexts, e.g. within table cells.

=== Block admonitions

The syntax for a block admonition is as follows.

[source,adoc]
----
[NOTE] <1>
==== <2>
Content of the admonition block. <3>

Unlike an admonition paragraph, it may contain any AsciiDoc content.
==== <4>
----
<1> Admonition type in all caps enclosed in square brackets
<2> Block start delimiter with 4 `=` signs.
<3> Multi-paragraph admonition content.
<4> Block end delimiter with 4 `=` signs.

=== Specifying DANGER and SAFETY

If the admonitions "`Danger`" and "`Safety Precaution`" are needed, they should
be indicated through a `type` attribute, which will override the admonition type
appearing.

[type=Danger]
CAUTION: Do not perform maintenance tasks while the machine is still operating.

[WARNING,type=Safety Precaution]
====
This is a safety precaution

spanning multiple-blocks.

=== Folding notes

==== General

Notes that are not at the end of a clause are folded into the preceding block,
if that block is not delimited (so that the user could not choose to include or exclude a note).

That is, notes immediately following these block types are automatically folded
into the preceding element:

* list
* formula
* figure
* table


==== Prevent folding

To prevent a note from folding into the preceding block, add the attribute
`keep-separate` to the
note [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.29].

NOTE: Extended to apply to tables [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.6].

[source,asciidoc]
--
* A
* B
* C

[NOTE,keep-separate=true]
====
Note not folded into its preceding block
====
--

Without the `keep-separate=true` markup, the note would be attached to the list,
and numbered accordingly.


[source,asciidoc]
--
[NOTE]
This note will be folded in the preceding block.

NOTE: This one too.

Notes may be given a type through the attribute
`type` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.4.1].

=== Explicitly-defined terminology entry notes

Normally, notes are only tagged as term notes when they appear in the context of
a terms section.

Rarely, term notes need to be presented in isolation, including in ISO
Amendments or Technical Corrigenda.

To achieve that, mark the note up with
`%termnote` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.1.2].

=== Whole document admonitions

Admonitions ("`NOTE`", "`IMPORTANT`", "`WARNING`", "`CAUTION`" etc.)
in the document body (i.e. within a main body clause) can be
stated to apply to the entire document by moving them to the
start of the document body, before the main sequence of clauses.

This can be done by giving them the attribute
`beforeclauses=true` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.30].

[source,asciidoc]
----
== Scope

[IMPORTANT,beforeclauses=true]
====
This important notice applies to the entire document.
====

My scope text...
----


=== Preface admonitions

Admonitions in the document prefaces (including in the Foreword) can be stated
to apply to the entire preface by moving them to the start of the preface,
before the Foreword. This can be done by giving them the same attribute
`beforeclauses=true` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.5.2].

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Document title
:document-attribute: XXXX

[IMPORTANT,beforeclauses=true]
====
This important notice applies to the entire document.
====

== Foreword

My foreword text...
----

=== Cover page admonitions

An admonition in the document prefaces can instead be flagged to be rendered on
the cover page of the document, through
`coverpage=true` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.0.8].

[source,asciidoc]
----
= Document title
:document-attribute: XXXX

[IMPORTANT,coverpage=true]
====

====

== Foreword

My foreword text...
----

Normally, the label of the type of admonition (_NOTE_, _IMPORTANT_, etc) is
inserted at the start of the admonition in rendering. This may not be desirable,
especially for coverpage admonitions.

Inserting the admonition type is suppressed through
`notag=true` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.0.8].

[source,asciidoc]
