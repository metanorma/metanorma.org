== Images

=== General

The inclusion of images in Metanorma AsciiDoc is through the `image` command.

Metanorma AsciiDoc supports most of the features of `image` defined in Asciidoctor AsciiDoc.
For more information, please refer to the typical `image` command attributes available at:
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/images/[Asciidoctor].

There are two types of AsciiDoc images, block and inline.

=== Block image
tag::tutorial[]

A block image is displayed as a discrete element, i.e., on its own line, in a document.

The syntax used to enter a block image is as follows.
The `image::` line is preceded by a blank line, entered on a line by itself,
and then followed by a blank line.

[source,adoc]
----
image::{PATH}[]
----

Where `PATH` is the image path.

In Metanorma, block images are always entered as a figure. Please refer to the
link:/author/topics/blocks/figures[Figures] documentation.

[source, AsciiDoc]
----
[[my-anchor]] <1>
.Title for image <2>
image::images/path.png[Alt text] <3>
----
<1> Optional anchor for referencing
<2> Image title
<3> Image command with path and optional alt text. If no alt text is provided, leave the square brackets at the end empty (`image::path[]`).

end::tutorial[]


=== Inline image

An inline image is displayed in the flow of another element, such as a paragraph.

This is useful when you want to incorporate buttons or other icons into the text flow.


=== Data URIs

Metanorma allows https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/Data_URIs[Data URIs] as the URL for an image:

[source,asciidoc]
--
image::data:image/png;base64,ivBO...[alt text]
--

NOTE: Data URIs are not typically supported by AsciiDoc processors.


=== Image directory location

The root path for all `image` paths can be defined at the document-level,
through the document attribute `:imagesdir:`.

[source,adoc]
----
= Document title
:imagesdir: my-images/ <1>

...
image::myimage01.png[] <2>
----
<1> The document attribute `:imagesdir:` will set all root paths of the `image` command to the specified path.
<2> The reference to `myimage01.png` is joined with the path set at `:imagesdir:`, which results to
`my-images/myimage01.png`.

More details of the `:imagesdir:` attribute can be found at
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/images-directory/[AsciiDoc documentation].


=== Attributes

==== Image size

The size of an image can be modified via the `height` and `width` attributes.

By default, both `height` and `width` are set to the value `auto`, which means
that the image will be shown according to the best visual settings determined
by Metanorma.

Image dimensions can also be fixed with pixel values with `px`.

NOTE: The pixel is the only supported unit in image sizing right now.

====
.Image resizing specifying `height` and `width` attributes in pixels
[source]
----
[height=150px,width=100px]
image::logo.jpg[]
----
====

In the `height` and `width` attributes, the `px` suffix may be omitted.


====
.Image resizing with values omitting `px` unit
[source,asciidoc]
--
[height=150,width=100]
image::logo.jpg[]
--
====

The `auto` value indicates that the dimension does not have a fixed size but
retain the aspect ratio of the original image.

====
.Aspect ratio is retained with `width` set to `auto` based on the value of `height`
[source,asciidoc]
--
[height=150,width=auto]
image::logo.jpg[]
--
====

An unspecified dimension is considered `auto`.

====
.Aspect ratio is retained when setting `height` but not `width`
[source,asciidoc]
--
[height=150]
image::logo.jpg[]
--
====

NOTE: Treatment of image resizing may slightly differ across output formats.


=== Captions and titles

As elsewhere in Metanorma, the caption of an image (of the figure containing the image)
is set with a line prefixed with dot above the image.

[source,asciidoc]
--
.Caption
image::logo.jpg[]
--

[source,asciidoc]
--
image::logo.jpg[title=Caption]
--

NOTE: Similar to Asciidoctor AsciiDoc, the `title` attribute is treated as
identical to the dot-prefixed caption.


Metanorma supports a `title` attribute on images for accessibility, which is
distinct from the figure caption.
This is entered in Metanorma as the `titleattr` attribute:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[titleattr=Title Attribute]
image::logo.jpg
--

Or

[source,asciidoc]
--
image::logo.jpg[titleattr=Title Attribute]
--

Both captions and titles could be used together.

[source,asciidoc]
--
.Rice husk separation in rice farm at Breton near Dinan
image::logo.jpg[titleattr=Photo of rice husks being separated]
--

NOTE: The `titleattr` attribute does not get rendered in Word output due to Word
limitations. Word only supports a single image "`Alt Text`", which would be set
by the caption.
Word's description of "`Alt Text`" is:
"`How would you describe this object and its context to someone who is blind?`".


==== Other attributes

NOTE: For general attributes of the `image` command, please refer to the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/image-ref/[AsciiDoc image documentation]. The following paragraphs describe Metanorma-specific behavior.
