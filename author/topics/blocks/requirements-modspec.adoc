== OGC Modular Specification ("ModSpec") requirements model scheme

=== General

This document describes methods used to encode OGC requirements adhering to
the https://www.ogc.org/standards/modularspec[OGC Modular Specification (ModSpec)].

OGC ModSpec (https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3])
specifies a requirements model scheme where requirements are expressed through a
set of UML models, with description on how these models are to be treated and
presented in OGC standards.

Metanorma provides a special syntax for the encoding and embedding of
requirements compliant to OGC ModSpec, for the exporting of machine-readable
requirements as well as ModSpec compliant rendering.

This model was developed for OGC, but it can be used in any flavour of
Metanorma [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.2.1].

The rendering of ModSpec requirements may vary in different Metanorma flavours from that
of metanorma-ogc; the metanorma-ogc rendering is shown here, unless otherwise indicated.

Specifically, the following models in ModSpec are supported:

* Conformance class
* Conformance test
* Requirements class
* Normative statements
** Requirement
** Recommendation
** Permission (not specified in ModSpec but allowed in
https://www.iso.org/standard/26010.html[ISO 19105],
see https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3], 4.20)

NOTE: The "`Conformance suite`", "`Conformance module`", "`Requirements module`"
models are not yet supported in Metanorma. Please contact
https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/docteam[OGC DocTeam] if support is required.

In this document, we refer to "`recommendations`", "`requirements`" and
"`permissions`" collectively using the generic term "`requirement`".

[NOTE]
--
In some instances, the naming of terms that Metanorma uses in general is
used in Metanorma markup instead of the nomenclature used in the
https://www.ogc.org/standards/modularspec[OGC Modular Specification (ModSpec)]:

* Metanorma uses _target_ to refer to what the requirement is about, rather
than the more specific language of the ModSpec, to ensure that requirements are
represented consistently within Metanorma.

* The different types of requirement expressed by Metanorma for ModSpec are about
different things, and the more abstract types of requirement are about other
requirements.
--

=== ModSpec models

A basic understanding of ModSpec is crucial in order to understand how to encode
ModSpec-compliant models.

In simplified terms (see https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3], Annex C):

* A "`Requirement class`" consists of multiple "`Requirements`".

** All "`Requirements`" within a "`Requirement class`" are about the same
standardization target type.

* A "`Requirement`" is a condition to be satisfied by a single standardization
target type.

* A "`Conformance class`" consists of multiple "`Conformance tests`".

** A "`Conformance class`" is associated with a single corresponding
"`Requirements class`".

** Each "`Conformance test`" within the "`Conformance class`"
corresponds to a set of "`Requirements`" within the corresponding
"`Requirements class`".

* A "`Conformance test`" checks if a set of "`Requirements`" is met by a single
standardization target (an entity).

** A "`Conformance test`" has a many-to-many relation with "`Requirements`".

** A "`Conformance test`" is about a single standardization target.

** A "`Conformance test`" can be "`concrete`" or "`abstract`" depending on the
type of conformance test suite (see https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3], 6.4).
A concrete conformance test is typically called as a "`conformance test`",
while an abstract conformance test is called an "`abstract test`".

* A "`Test suite`" is "`a collection of identifiable conformance classes`"
(see https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3], 6.4)

** A "`Conformance test suite`" contains only "`Conformance classes`" of the
"`concrete`" kind. Such conformance class can only contain "`concrete`"
conformance tests.

** An "`Abstract test suite`" contains only "`Conformance classes`" of the
"`abstract`" kind. Such conformance class can only contain Abstract tests.

// NOTE: In order to match the Metanorma encoding of requirements to legacy OGC
// AsciiDoc markup of requirements, users can refer to the rendering of Metanorma
// requirements which is aligned the existing, tabular OGC encoding of
// requirements.

According to the https://www.ogc.org/ogc/policies/directives[OGC Policy Directives],
OGC standards that contain requirements must have those requirements conform to
https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3].


=== Rendering

Modspec instnace headings are treated like clause headings in HTML
output [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v2.5.9]
in order to enable easier hyperlinking of Modspec instances.

* a section mark glyph (ยง) is displayed when the mouse is hovered over the
Modspec instance heading;

* when the heading is clicked on, the browser location bar displays the
hyperlink with anchor to the Modspec instance.


=== Encoding syntax

==== General

A requirement (in its generic meaning) is encoded via tagged example blocks
containing other tagged example blocks and open blocks.

There are two ways to encode a ModSpec instance:

. Via definition lists
. Via block attributes

The definition lists method is generally recommended for its multi-line syntax
but some authors may prefer specifying attributes in the header.

WARNING: Not all attributes are supported in the block attribute syntax.
Specifically, `target`, `indirect-dependency` are not supported.

NOTE: These two methods originate from Metanorma's general support of the
alternative syntaxes for specifying a block attribute list as a definition list.
The extension of the definition lists syntax to components is specific to
Metanorma OGC.


[[instance-syntax]]
==== Instance syntax

In Metanorma, the recommended way to encode a ModSpec instance is via the
*definition list* syntax.

This syntax requires specification of a `[%metadata]` definition list within a
ModSpec instance, which provides the necessary information for the specified
model. Values given in the definition list syntax can be fully-formatted
Metanorma AsciiDoc text.

A ModSpec model instance is encoded with one of these block types:

* `[requirement]` for Requirement
* `[recommendation]` for Recommendation
* `[permission]` for Permission
* `[requirements_class]` for Requirements class
* `[conformance_test]` for Conformance test
* `[conformance_class]` for Conformance class
* `[abstract_test]` for Abstract test

NOTE: These ModSpec types are available from [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.3]

In addition, if the Metanorma generic `[requirements]` block is used, these
values are to be used in the `type` attribute.

The following two encodings are equivalent:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[conformance_test]
----

[source,asciidoc]
----
[requirement,type=conformance_test]
----


Attributes that can take rich textual input (Metanorma AsciiDoc input), such as
`part`, `conditions`, and `guidance`, are components of requirements in
Metanorma.

These can be encoded within the definition list, or in the block attributes
syntax using the `[.component]` role within the ModSpec instance block, on open
blocks or example blocks.

[example]
.Example of encoding a ModSpec requirement "part" within the definition list
======

----
[requirement]
====
[%metadata]
identifier:: /req/world/hello
part:: Part A of the requirement.

----
[requirement]
=====
[%metadata]

====
Part A of the requirement.
====

----
======

The `%metadata` definition list may contain embedded
levels [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.3];
this is needed specifically for steps embedded within a test method.

If you need to insert a cross-reference to a component, for example referencing
a specific part of a requirement elsewhere, you can only use the block
attributes sequence (as illustrated above).


[source,asciidoc]

UML conceptual models.

test-method::

step::: Step 2

step::: Step 3
====
----


When using ModSpec within other documents that, by default, uses another
requirements model scheme (such as non-OGC flavors), it is necessary specify the
instance with the `model` attribute.

This is an OGC ModSpec requirement within an ISO document.
====
----
======


==== Instance attributes

Attributes accepted by a ModSpec instance are as follows.
Differentiated types of ModSpec models allow additional attributes.

`identifier`:: (mandatory) Identifier of the requirement, such as a URI or a
URN. Plain text.
+
This must be unique in the document (as required by ModSpec), and is also used
for referencing and cross-linking between ModSpec instances.
+
NOTE: The `identifier` was previously encoded as `label` until
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v2.2.0 .

`subject`:: (optional) Subject that the model refers to. Plain text.

`obligation`:: (optional) Accepted values are one of:
`requirement`::: (default) The instance is a requirement.
`recommendation`::: The instance is a recommendation.
`permission`::: The instance is a permission.

`description`:: (optional)
The descriptive text for this instance.
+
NOTE: In a normative statement, the `description` key is treated as a synonym of
`statement`, which forms the statement of compliance itself instead of
informative, descriptive,
text. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/mn-requirements/releases/tag/v0.2.1].

`target`:: (conditional: only for conformance-related models)
The "target" that is being tested against, specified with the identifier of the
requirement or requirements class. (Replaces `subject` in that context.)
+
NOTE: The `target` is only supported in definition list syntax. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v2.2.0]

*** When in a conformance test (or an abstract test), specify the corresponding
identifier of the requirement that is being tested.

*** When in a conformance class, specify the corresponding identifier of the
requirement class that is being tested.

// * `model` (optional when using Metanorma OGC). Type of model. The value of `ogc`
// means using OGC ModSpec models.

`class`::
Declares a custom category of provisions labelled and numbered separately to
"requirements", "recommendations" and
"permissions" [added in https://github.com/metanorma/mn-requirements/releases/tag/v0.4.1].
+
.Rendering of a custom category called "Provision"
[example]

----

--

[requirement]
--
[%metadata]
class:: Provision
--
----

Rendered as:

____
*Provision 1*

*Requirement 1*

*Provision 2*
____
====


`id`::
+
--
(optional) Predefined anchor of the requirement.

By default:

* If `identifier` is provided, it is set identically to the
`identifier` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/mn-requirements/releases/tag/v0.3.7].
* Otherwise, it is set to a generated GUID that is derived from a hash of its
content.

The predefined anchor is used in Metanorma for <<predef-xref,element referencing>>
though the Modspec `identifier` is the recommended method for <<identifier-xref,referencing of requirements>>.

This attribute can also be expressed as:

* block anchor: `\[[idvalue]]`
* hash attribute: `[#idvalue]`
--

Accepted values::: Same as XML IDs. Unaccepted characters (including `/`) are
replaced with `_`.



[[generalreqt]]
==== Normative statement

Metanorma ModSpec supports the following normative statement types:

* Requirement (`requirement`)
* Recommendation (`recommendation`)
* Permission (`permission`)

The type of normative statement can be specified with using the above
values as block types, or by setting the `type` attribute of a block.

It supports the following attributes in addition to base ModSpec attributes:

`statement`:: (mandatory)
The statement to which compliance applies within this provision.
+
NOTE: Prior to mn-requirements v0.2.1, the key `description` is used.
`description` is now a synonym for `statement` in a provision
instance [added in https://github.com/metanorma/mn-requirements/releases/tag/v0.2.1].

`conditions`:: (optional)
Conditions on where this requirement applies. Accepts rich text.

`part`:: (optional) A requirement can contain multiple parts of
sub-requirements. Accepts rich text. Labelled with a capital alphabetic letter.

NOTE: A part is distinct from a step (as appears in <<conftest>>): a part is a
component of a requirement, which is itself a requirement. A step is a stage in
a process of testing a requirement: it only makes sense within a test method.

`guidance`:: (optional) Guidance on how to apply the requirement. Used to avoid
numbering of notes or examples as part of the overall document. Accepts
rich text. Guidance is always rendered last in ModSpec. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/mn-requirements/releases/tag/v0.1.4]

`inherit`:: (optional) A requirement can inherit from one or more requirements
(_direct dependency_ in ModSpec terms).
Accepts identifiers of other requirements: multiple values are semicolon-delimited.
Can be repeated in definition list syntax.

`indirect-dependency`:: (optional) A requirement can inherit indirectly
from one or more requirement classes, which have a different standardization target from that of the
requirement. That requirement class is used, produced, or associated with the current requirement,
but its requirements are not inherited by this requirement.
Only supported in definition list syntax. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v2.2.1]

`implements`:: (optional) A requirement can implement another requirement.
Accepts identifiers of other requirements. Can be repeated in definition list
syntax [added in https://github.com/metanorma/mn-requirements/releases/tag/v0.1.9].

`classification`:: (optional) Classification of this requirement.
The `classification` attribute is marked up as in the rest of Metanorma:
`key1=value1;key2=value2...`, where _value_ is either a single
string, or a comma-delimited list of values.

`requirement`, `permission`, `recommendation`:: A requirement, permission, or recommendation
contained within a requirement. The value of the element is its identifier.
Only supported in definition list syntax.

`conformance-test`, `abstract-test`, `conformance-class`,
`requirement-class` `recommendation-class`, `permission-class`::
A requirement, permission, or recommendation of those categories,
contained within a requirement. The value of the element is its identifier.
Only supported in definition list syntax. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/mn-requirements/releases/tag/v0.1.6]

NOTE: `conditions`, `part` supported since [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.2].

NOTE: In the default rendering of ModSpec, the `statement` attribute,
descriptions are labelled as _Statement_ for requirements, recommendations,
permissions. They are left as _Description_ for all other kinds of ModSpec
instances.

[[reqt_class]]
==== Requirements class

A "`Requirements class`" is encoded as a block of `requirements_class` or using
`type` equals to `requirements_class`.

A Requirements class is cross-referenced and captioned as a
"`{Requirement} class {N}`" [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v0.2.11].

NOTE: Classes for Recommendations will be captioned as
"`Recommendations class {N}`", similarly for "`Requirements class {N}`" and
"`Permissions class {N}`".

Requirements classes allow the following attributes in addition to the base
ModSpec attributes:

Name:: (mandatory) Name of the requirements class should be specified as the
block caption.

`subject`:: (mandatory) The Target Type. Rendered as _Target Type_.

`inherit`:: (optional)
Dependent requirements classes. See <<generalreqt,Requirement, recommendation, permission>>.

`indirect-dependency`:: (optional)
Indirect dependent requirements classes. See <<generalreqt,Requirement, recommendation, permission>>.

`guidance`:: (optional)
Guidance on requirement class. See <<generalreqt,Requirement, recommendation, permission>>.

Embedded requirements (optional)::
Requirements contained in a class are marked up as nested requirements.

NOTE: In this example, both block attributes and definition list syntax is used;
the `inherit` attribute has two values, which are expressed in the definition list.

// TODO: Add rendering example

A requirements class can contain multiple requirements, specified with embedded
requirements.

The contents of these embedded requirements may be specified within the
requirements class, or specified outside of the requirements class (referenced
using the identifier). If the requirement is specified within a definition list,
the definition list value is interpreted as the requirement identifier.

==== Conformance class

Specified by setting the block as `conformance_class` or by using `type` as
`conformance_class`.

A Conformance class is cross-referenced and captioned as
"`Conformance class {N}`", and is otherwise rendered identically to a
"`Requirements class`" [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.0.4].

Conformance classes support the following attributes in addition to base ModSpec
attributes:

`target`:: (mandatory) Associated Requirements class. Populated with the identifier of the
Requirements class. Rendered as _Requirements Class_.

`inherit`:: (optional) Dependencies of the conformance class. Accepts multiple
values, which are the identifiers of other requirements.
See <<generalreqt,Requirement, recommendation, permission>>.

`indirect-dependency`:: (optional) Indirect dependent requirements classes. See
<<generalreqt,Requirement, recommendation, permission>>.

Conformance classes also feature:

Name:: (optional) Specified as the block caption.

Nesting:: (optional) Conformance tests contained in a conformance class are
encoded as conformance tests within the conformance class block, marked as
`conformance-test`. See <<reqt_class,Requirements class>>.

NOTE: Conformance classes do not have a Target Type (as specified in ModSpec).
If one must be encoded, it should be encoded as a classification key-value
pair.

[[conftest]]
==== Conformance test and Abstract test

A "`Conformance test`" can be "`concrete`" or "`abstract`" depending on the type
of conformance test suite (see https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3], 6.4).

The OGC author should identify whether a standard requires an "`Abstract test
suite`" or a "`Conformance test suite`" in order to decide the encoding of
"`Conformance tests`" (concrete tests) versus "`Abstract tests`".

* A conformance test is specified by creating a `conformance_test` block or
using `type` as `conformance_test`.
It is cross-referenced as "`Conformance test {N}`"

* An abstract test is specified by creating an `abstract_test` block or using
`type` as `abstract_test`, or `conformance_test` together with
`abstract=true`.
It is cross-referenced as "`Abstract test {N}`" [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.0.4].

// NOTE: Verifications for Recommendations will be captioned as
// Recommendation Tests, similarly for Requirement Tests and
// Permission Tests.

Conformance tests support the following attributes and components in addition to
base ModSpec attributes:

`target`:: The associated requirement. Populated with the identifier of the requirement.
Multiple semicolon-delimited values may be provided. Rendered as _Requirement_.

`inherit`:: (optional) Dependencies. Accepts multiple values, which are the identifiers
of other requirements.  See <<generalreqt,Requirement, recommendation, permission>>.
* `indirect-dependency` (optional). Indirect dependent requirements classes. See <<generalreqt,Requirement, recommendation, permission>>.

Components:: (optional) Components of the conformance test. Accepts rich
text. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.0].
Allows the following classes:

`test-purpose`::: (optional) Purpose of the test. Rich text. Presented as _Test
Purpose_ [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.2]

`test-method`::: (optional) Method of the test. Rich text. Presented as _Test
Method_ [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.2]

`step`::: (optional) Step of the test method. Is expected to be embedded within `test-method`,
and may contain substeps of its own. Rich text. Presented as a numbered list.
added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.2].
+
Steps can be nested, the nested list order is: _arabic_, then _alphabetic_, then
_roman_.

`test-method-type`::: (optional) Method of the test. Rich text. Presented as
_Test Method Type_ [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.3]

`reference`::: (optional) Purpose of the test. Rich text. Presented as _Reference_.

Test type:: The test type of a Conformance test is encoded as a `classification` key-value pair.


Conformance tests also feature:

* Name (optional). Specified as the requirement's block caption.

NOTE: Conformance Tests are excluded from the "`Table of Requirements`" in Word
output [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v0.2.10].

=== Cross-referencing ModSpec instances

==== General

Similar to when specifying attributes for ModSpec instances, it is preferred to
refer to other instances using identifiers, rather than the numbered labels
allocated by default.

Metanorma treats both cross-referncing mechanisms as fully equivalent, and will
render them in the same way, as a numbered label (_Requirement Class 6_).

[example]
====
In OGC, it is preferred to show the identifier of a ModSpec instance in a
cross-reference, like `http://www.example.com/req/crs/crs-uri` instead of
_Requirement Class 6_.
====

[[identifier-xref]]
==== Referencing using instance identifiers

Modspec in Metanorma supports
link:/author/topics/document-format/xrefs/#anchor-aliasing[anchor aliasing]: the
identifier of the requirement can be used in cross-references as an alias of the
anchor.

This is the preferred method to cross-reference Modspec instances, through its
identifier instead of the predefined anchor.

[NOTE]
--
This is due to the following reasons:

* not all ModSpec instances are assigned predefined anchors, especially when
using model-based generation.
* using predefined anchors precludes automated manipulation of the identifier
base path.
--

Metanorma will automatically map the anchor it allocates to requirements to
identifiers, so users do not need to supply the anchor alias mappings
manually.

.Cross-reference to a ModSpec instance using its identifier, displaying the instance's name
[example]
=====
For a requirement such as:

[source,adoc]
----
[[id1]]
[requirement]
====
identifier:: http://www.example.com/req/crs/crs-uri
====
----

The following cross-reference:

[source,adoc]
----
xref:http://www.example.com/req/crs/crs-uri[]
----

Renders (assuming that this is the 10th Requirement):

____
Requirement 10: `http://www.example.com/req/crs/crs-uri`
____
=====

NOTE: As a limitation of syntax, URIs cannot be processed correctly within
`<<..>>`. The `xref:...[]` command needs to be used instead.


[[predef-xref]]
==== Referencing using predefined anchors

The anchor of the requirement can be used in a normal cross-reference.

.Cross-reference to a ModSpec instance using a predefined anchor
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
<<id1,http://www.example.com/req/crs/crs-uri>>
----

____
Requirement 10: `http://www.example.com/req/crs/crs-uri`
____
====


==== Cross-reference rendering

Following Modspec practice, all cross-references to Modspec instances from within another
Modspec instance are rendered
along with the URI identifier of that instance where available; the URI is truncated
with reference to an identifier base (see <<identifier-base>>).

So a reference to `<<id1>>` or to `xref:http://www.example.com/req/crs/crs-uri[]` made within
a Modspec instance will render as

____
Requirement 10: `http://www.example.com/req/crs/crs-uri`
____

If the reference occurs outside a Modspec instance however, e.g. in a normal clause,
it will be made like any other cross-reference to a requirement, without the URI.

____
Clause 7.3.2, Requirement 10
____

If you want the reference made outside a Modspec instance to render as if it is inside a Modspec
instance, with the URI, use `style=modspec%`:

[source,adoc]
----
xref:http://www.example.com/req/crs/crs-uri[style=modspec%]

<<id1,style=modspec%>>
----

To make the cross-reference render the URI identifier value of the instance itself,
while still hyperlinking to the correct identifier, you can specify `style=id%`
as the cross-reference text, as follows.

.Cross-reference to a ModSpec instance using its identifier, displaying the instance's identifier
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
xref:http://www.example.com/req/crs/crs-uri[style=id%]
----

Renders as:

`http://www.example.com/req/crs/crs-uri`
====

This will also highlight the URI text as subject to truncation, with reference
to identifier bases.

In some flavours (ISO as of this writing), the automatically generated cross-references
within requirements (listings of provisions, tests, child and parent requirements) is different
from the default rendering of cross-references in documents. In order to use the same
cross-reference style as occurs inside of requirements, you can specify
`style=modspec%` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/mn-requirements/releases/tag/v0.3.1].

For example, in ISO, in the main body of text

[[identifier-base]]
==== Identifier base pattern

NOTE: This functionality is first implemented in [added in https://github.com/metanorma/mn-requirements/releases/tag/v0.2.1].

A ModSpec instance can be cross-referenced from other parts of the document,
with the reference text used to identify the ModSpec instance named either
according to its:

* instance label (e.g. "Requirement 3"); or
* identifier (e.g. `http://www.opengis.net/spec/waterml/2.0/req/xsd-xml-rules`)

ModSpec instances need to be assigned unique identifiers, which are typically
either
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier[URIs],
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Name[URNs] or
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL[URLs].

These identifier types utilize a hierarchical pattern. If two identifiers share
a common prefix, it means that the two identifiers can be grouped semantically
at some level.

In well-structured standards (in OGC and others), ModSpec instances often share
a common identifier prefix. For example, a defined, document-wide identifier
prefix is used as the "base" for all ModSpec identifiers.

[example]
.Document-wide identifier prefix with ModSpec instances using that prefix
====
OGC WaterML 2.0 applies a document identifier prefix:

* document identifier prefix: `http://www.opengis.net/spec/waterml/2.0`
* sample of a ModSpec instance identifier in the document:
  `http://www.opengis.net/spec/waterml/2.0/req/xsd-xml-rules`
====

When cross-referencing a ModSpec instance using its identifier, the references
can be lengthy to read.

If a document-wide identifier "base prefix" is defined, Metanorma will omit the
base prefix in the rendering of ModSpec instances when using the identifier as
reference text.

There are the following ways of specifying an identifier base prefix:

Document-wide:: The document attribute `:modspec-identifier-base:` is used
to specify the identifier base prefix for the entire document.

ModSpec class instance:: An identifier base prefix can be defined inside a
ModSpec class instance (e.g. Requirements class), using the definition list tag
`identifier-base`.

ModSpec instance:: An identifier base prefix can be defined inside a ModSpec
instance (e.g. Requirement), using the definition list tag `identifier-base`.

The behavior is specified as follows:

* If an identifier base prefix is specified document-wide:

** When a ModSpec instance or class instance is cross-referenced using its
identifier, the identifier base prefix will be removed from the identifier in
the reference text.

* If an identifier base prefix is specified on a ModSpec class instance (e.g. Requirements class):

** This identifier base prefix overrides any value specified in
`:modspec-identifier-base:`, if any.

** The identifier base prefix specified will apply to all its ModSpec instances
(e.g. Requirements in the Requirements class) unless overridden.

** When a ModSpec class instance is cross-referenced using its identifier, the
identifier base prefix will be removed from the identifier in the reference
text.

* If an identifier base prefix is specified on a ModSpec instance (e.g. Requirement):

** The identifier base prefix specified on the instance overrides all higher
level identifier base prefixes;

** The identifier base prefix specified on the instance's class (e.g. Requirements class)
overrides any value specified in `:modspec-identifier-base:`, if any;

** When the instance is cross-referenced using its identifier, the
identifier base prefix will be removed from the identifier in the reference
text.

NOTE: An identifier base specified on a requirement applies to all ModSpec
requirement cross-references rendered within that requirement. The identifier base
truncation is applied to cross-references rendered as just the identifier (`style=id%`),
but it is also applied to the identifiers incorporated inside of normal cross-references,
and to the identifier labels of requirements.

=== Rendering of ModSpec instances

ModSpec instances are rendered in a table format.

NOTE: This rendering method is consistent with prior OGC ModSpec practice.

* For HTML rendering, the CSS class of the ModSpec specification table is the
`type` attribute of the requirement.
+
--
The following types are recognised:

** No value for Requirements
** `conformance_test` for Conformance tests
** `abstract_test` for Abstract tests
** `requirements_class` for Requirements classes
** `conformance_class` for Conformance classes

NOTE: The default CSS class currently assigned for HTML rendering is `recommend`.
--

* The heading of the table (spanning two columns) is its name (the role
or style of the requirement, e.g. `[permission]` or `[.permission]`), optionally
followed by its title (the caption of the requirement, e.g. `.Title`).

* The title of the table (spanning two columns) is its `identifier` attribute.

* The initial rows of the body of the table give metadata about the requirement.
They include:

** The `obligation` attribute of the requirement, if given: _Obligation_
followed by the attribute value

** The `subject` attribute of the requirement, if given: _Subject_, followed by the attribute.
The subject attribute can be marked up as a cross-reference
to another requirement given in the same document. If there are multiple values of the subject,
they are semicolon delimited [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.4].

** The `inherit` attribute of the requirement, if given: _Dependency_ followed
by the attribute value. If there are multiple values of the attribute,
they are semicolon delimited.

** The `indirect-dependency` attribute of the requirement, if given:
_Indirect Dependency_ followed by the attribute value. If there are multiple
values of the attribute, they are semicolon delimited.

** The `classification` attributes of the requirement, if given: the
classification tag (in capitals), followed by the classification value.

* The remaining rows of the requirement are the remaining components of the
requirement, encoded as table rows instead of as a definition table (as they are
by default in Metanorma).

** These include the explicit `component` components of the
requirement [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.0],
which capture internal components of the requirement defined in ModSpec.
+
These are divided into two categories:

*** Components with a `class` attribute other than `part` are
extracted in order, with the class name normalised (title case), followed by the component contents.
So a component with a `class` attribute of `conditions` will be rendered as
_Conditions_ followed by the component contents. In the foregoing, we have seen components defined
in ModSpec: `test-purpose, test-method, test-method-type, conditions, reference`. However the block attribute
syntax allows open-ended component names.

*** Components with the `class` attribute `part` are extracted and presented in
order: each Part is rendered as an incrementing capital letter (_A_, _B_, _C_
and so on), followed by the component contents. Any cross-references to part components
will automatically be labelled with the identifier of their parent requirement, followed by their ordinal
letter.

** Components can include descriptive text (`description`), which is interleaved with
other components.

** Components can include open blocks marked with role attributes. That includes the
legacy Metanorma components:

*** `[.specification]`
*** `[.measurement-target]`
*** `[.verification]`
*** `[.import]`


=== Legacy usage

==== Specifying instances using block attributes

Traditionally in Metanorma, the following two encoding syntaxes are considered
equivalent.

* In the *definition list* syntax, where a `[%metadata]` definition list within
a ModSpec instance provides the necessary information for the specified model,
as described in <<instance-syntax>>.

* In the *block attributes* syntax, the necessary information is provided as an
attribute list to the block.
Values contained in the attribute list must be in plain text.

The *block attributes* syntax is now deprecated as the syntax only supports
plain text values, and does not support rich text or complex values.

This limitation means that when used with components, the block attributes
syntax must also be mixed with the definition list syntax.

Attributes that can take rich textual input (Metanorma AsciiDoc input), such as
`part`, `conditions`, and `guidance`, are components of requirements, and have
to be encoded in the block attributes syntax using the `[.component]` role
within the ModSpec instance block, on open blocks or example blocks.

[example]
.Example of encoding a ModSpec requirement "part" in an open block syntax
====
[source,adoc]
----
[.component,class=part]
--
Part A of the requirement.
--
----
====

[example]
.Example of encoding a ModSpec requirement "part" in an example block syntax
======
[source,adoc]
----
[.component,class=part]
====
Part A of the requirement.
====
----
======

Conversely, in definition list syntax, not only components such as `part` and
`conditions`, but also `description` for descriptive text, can be specified
in the definition list. (In block attributes syntax, descriptive text is left
as normal text.)

The definition list may contain embedded levels [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.3];
this is needed specifically for steps embedded within a test method.

If you need to insert a cross-reference to a component, for example referencing
a specific part of a requirement elsewhere, you can only use the block
attributes sequence (as illustrated above).

The following two examples demonstrate encoding of a ModSpec requirement
that are encoded in Metanorma XML identically (and therefore rendered
identically in output).

These two syntaxes can be mixed.




==== Legacy Metanorma OGC AsciiDoc syntax

For legacy reasons, a second Metanorma OGC AsciiDoc syntax is permitted for
recommendations, requirements and permissions.

In this syntax, Metanorma AsciiDoc tables are used to express the
data needed for requirements:

* Type of requirement. Specified in the first table cell,
  one of `Recommendation`, `Requirement` or `Permission`.

** Optionally followed by a number
  (which is ignored in parsing; the elements are renumbered automatically in
  rendering.)

* Internal label. First paragraph of the second table cell.

* Body of requirement. Second and subsequent paragraphs of the second table cell.

[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
[[recommendation1]]
|===
|Recommendation |/ogc/recommendation/wfs/2 +

If the API definition document uses the OpenAPI Specification 3.0,
the document SHOULD conform to the
<<rc_oas30,OpenAPI Specification 3.0 requirements class>>.

==== Legacy ModSpec type keywords

These values for the ModSpec model type have been deprecated:

* `general` for Requirement, Recommendation or Permission (now `requirement`, `recommendation` or `permission`)
* `class` for Requirements class (now `requirements_class`)
* `verification` for Conformance test (now `conformance_test`)
* `conformanceclass` for Conformance class (now `conformance_class`)
* `abstracttest` for Abstract test (now `abstract_test`)
