== General

Tables are useful for displaying data of the same structure.

Metanorma AsciiDoc tables are required to handle the full range of complexity
of standardization documents, and is therefore significantly more
powerful than typical AsciiDoc tables.

NOTE: Typical AsciiDoc already handles tables very well for a non-XML markup language.


== Basics

// tag::tutorial[]
Metanorma AsciiDoc supports all basic table syntaxes of AsciiDoc, including:

* cells spanning multiple rows and columns;
* horizontal alignment;
* vertical alignment [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.5.3].

Given AsciiDoc is a plain-text format, it uses specific symbols to determine
where new table rows and columns begin.

.Example of a simple AsciiDoc table
[source,adoc]
----
[cols="1,1"] <1>
.A table with a title <2>
|=== <3>
|Cell in column 1, header row |Cell in column 2, header row <4>

|Cell in column 1, row 2
|Cell in column 2, row 2 <5>
|=== <6>
----
<1> Optional table attributes that specifies the table structure.
The numbers specify the relative amount of spacing between the columns.
`cols="x,x"` indicates that there are two columns.
<2> The table title can be assigned by beginning a line with a dot `.`. Make
sure that there is no space between the dot and the first word of the heading.
<3> Starting table delimiter `|===`
<4> Header row. The line immediately after the starting delimiter is the header row.
To add a column, add a vertical bar `|` before the text that should be in the column.
<5> When using the `[cols]` attribute, columns in the same row can appear on different lines of AsciiDoc text.
Otherwise, they need to all be on the same line of text, like in <4>.
<6> Closing table delimiter `|===`

// end::tutorial[]

TIP: For table formatting options, such as joining cells or
setting text alignment, please refer to
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/tables/align-by-cell/[AsciiDoc table documentation].


== Table width

The table width can be set with the `width`
attribute [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.21].

`width`:: Width of table. Valid values listed below.

`{percentage}%`:::
a percentage (e.g. `70%`)

`{pixels}px`:::
a pixel count (e.g. `500px`)

`full-page-width`:::
PDF-specific. Specifies that the table spans the whole page width
regardless of the number of columns on the page.
 [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.8.6]
+
NOTE: This feature is not supported in typical AsciiDoc.

`text-width`::: PDF-specific. Specified that the table will be as wide as
the text column that contains it.
 [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.8.6]
+
NOTE: This feature is not supported in typical AsciiDoc.

NOTE: The non-PDF `width` attribute values align with HTML CSS and HTML 4 behavior.

.Table width spanning 70% of the rendered output medium
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
[width=70%]
|===
| Vehicle | Passenger

| Mazda 3 | Bob
| Tesla Model Y | Alice

|===
----
====

====
[source,asciidoc]
----
[width=full-page-width]
|===
|A |B

|C |D
|===
----
====

== Column width

Table columns can also have their widths set [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.5.3].

Table column widths must be enumerated explicitly per column to generate column widths.

[example]
.Example of table with equal width columns
====
The following syntax will be processed as generating equal width columns.

[source,adoc]
----
[cols="1,1,1"]
----
====

NOTE: In typical AsciiDoc, `[cols="3"]` is considered a shorthand to
`[cols="1,1,1"]`, but this is not supported in Metanorma AsciiDoc.

For long tables that need to continue onto the next page in the DOC or PDF rendering of a document,
Metanorma, by default, will automatically repeat the header after every page break.

To suppress this behavior, you can apply the `noheader` value to the `options` attribute
using its formal (`options=noheader`) or shorthand (`%noheader`) syntax.
There is a caveat that this option will also deactivate the implicit assignment of the
header to the first row of the table
(see link:https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/tables/add-header-row/#implicitly-assign-header-to-the-first-row[Implicitly assign header to the first row]).
Therefore, you will need to apply the header tag (`h|`) to every cell of the first
row to define it as the header.


== Supplementary components

A table allows the following supplementary components:

* Key
* Text
* Notes
* Footnotes

The order of rendering of these components are in the following order:

* Key > Text > Note > Footnote

NOTE: This order aligns with ISO's editorial practice.

== Key

Key can be followed by a definition list for the variables
used in the table, just like formulae.

This definition list is marked up with `[%key]`
 [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.6.3].

The syntax is as follows:

[source,asciidoc]
--
|===
|Location |Distance

|Over there | 6
|===

[%key] <1>
{some-id}:: {some-description} <2>
--
<1> Specification of table key section
<2> Key entry: `{some-description}` is text that describes information about the thing
represented by `{some-id}`

[example]
.Table containing a key / legend
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
|===
|Location       | Distance

|Over here      | s
|Over there     | m
|Way over there | l
|===

[%key]
stem:[s]:: Short distance
stem:[m]:: Medium distance
stem:[l]:: Far away
--
====

NOTE: The key definition list can also be preceded by a paragraph consisting of
`\*Key*`, though that is not recommended.


== Notes and footnotes

Metanorma AsciiDoc tables behave differently from typical AsciiDoc
with notes and footnotes due to the requirements of standardization documents.

Specifically:

* table cell footnotes (``footnote:````[...]``) are rendered inside the table;
* notes (`NOTE: ...`) following the table are rendered inside the table footer.

NOTE: Typical AsciiDoc renders table cell footnotes inside the cell,
and notes trailing the table outside the table.

====
Table 1 in the Metanorma ISO Rice example document illustrates a large range of
table formatting options.

[[statement-units]]
== Statement concerning units

A statement concerning units used can be added to a table, indicating the units
of measurement used in the table.

NOTE: This currently applies to the ISO, IEC and BSI flavors, and flavors that
inherit from them.

The units statement is encoded as a NOTE of type `units` (`[NOTE,type=units]`).

The statement is rendered in the top-right corner of the
table [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-iso/releases/tag/v2.3.6].

.Table with a statement concerning units
====
[source,adoc]
----
|===
|Location |Distance

|Over there | 6
|===

[NOTE,type=units]
Distance in kilometres
----
====



== Multiple header rows

Metanorma AsciiDoc supports the option of multiple header rows via attribute
`headerrows` to deal with the complexity of standardization documents' tables
requiring labels, variables, and units to lining up in the header.

[source,adoc]
----
[headerrows=2]
|===
.2+|Sample 3+^| Value
| Test A | Test B | Test C

| Component 1 | Pass | Fail | Pass

|===
----

This renders as:

|===
.2+h|Sample 3+^h| Value
h| Test A h| Test B h| Test C

| Component 1 | Pass | Fail | Pass

|===

NOTE: This feature is not supported in typical AsciiDoc.


== Accessibility metadata

Metanorma AsciiDoc supports assigning accessibility metadata for tables,
including alt text and summary text, via table attributes.

`alt`:: alternate text that describes the table;
`summary`:: summary text that describes a summary of the content provided by the table.

Both are rendered as a summary of the table for accessibility.

NOTE: Alternate text is shown when the table can not be displayed (HTML only).

.Example of assigning alt text and summary text
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
[alt=Table of tested components,summary=Table of components being tested in Tests A to C]
.2+|Sample 3+^| Value
| Test A | Test B | Test C

| Component 1 | Pass | Fail | Pass

|===
----
====

NOTE: This feature is not supported in typical AsciiDoc.

5+a| Live insects shall not be present. Dead insects shall be included in extraneous matter.

[%key]
N/A:: Not applicable.

NOTE: Some commercial contracts require information in addition to that provided
in this table.

== Table sources

A table can incorporate an indication of its source,
which in Metanorma is expected to be a bibliographical reference, just as with
term sources [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.4.2].
Any such sources need to appear after the table, and before any notes which will also be
included in the table.
