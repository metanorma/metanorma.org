= Document sections

== General

// tag::tutorial[]

Sections define hierarchy levels in a document, as chapters do.
In AsciiDoc, sections are encoded with titles prefixed by equal signs (`=`).

* The document title is considered the highest section in the hierarchy, and is
created by prepending a `=` sign in front of the heading.
* Subsequent sections are encoded with titles prefixed with least two equal signs:
** `==` indicates a first-level section;
** `===` indicates a second-level section;
** `====` indicates a third-level subsection;
** and so on.

== Section types

=== Automatic type recognition

Metanorma automatically detects these standard section types when their titles match
common patterns in any supported language:

* Abstract
* Foreword
* Introduction
* Acknowledgements
* Executive summary
* Scope
* Normative references
* Terms and definitions
* Symbols and abbreviated terms (or individual Symbols/Abbreviated terms sections)
* Bibliography
* `metanorma-extension` (special container section)

// To successfully validate a document, the compiler needs to know what sections
// are in the document. Metanorma relies on these predefined section titles to
// check them against the document model.

The content body, or annexes, are entered as normal sections without need for
pre-defined titles.

Fixed section names are specific to either the preface of a document, or the main body;
so for example an instance of "Introduction" the main body of the text will not be treated
as part of the preface.

NOTE: The underlying document model behind all Metanorma flavors is called the
StandardDocument model, also abbreviated as "StanDoc".
The available section types available in StanDoc are reproduced in this section.
StanDoc represents the harmonized common requirements of standardization
documents, not the document model of a particular SDO.

Flavours may overrule these pre-defined section titles with titles of their own,
or may choose not to recognise at least some of them as special sections.

NOTE: Each organization is based on the standard document model but they can
omit sections or make them mandatory, if they choose to. For example, only NIST
uses the acknowledgments section, whereas other SDOs do not require it. Flavours
may overrule these pre-defined section titles with titles of their own, or may
choose not to recognise at least some of them as special sections. Check the
link:/flavors/[flavor documentation] for more details on how
your SDO uses Metanorma.


=== Manual type specification

If the section title does not match standardized title patterns, the section
type must be explicitly declared using attributes.

NOTE: Clause titles can differ from standardized titles for custom phrasing or
language differences.

[source,adoc]

Supported section type declarations include the following.

[cols="1,1,1", options="header"]
|===
|Section type |Standardized title |Declaration

|Metanorma Extension
|"Metanorma-Extension"
|`[heading=metanorma-extension]`

|Abstract
|"Abstract"
|`[abstract]`

|Foreword
|"Foreword"
|`[heading=foreword]`

|Preface
| No standardized title
|`[preface]`

|Introduction
|"Introduction"
|`[heading=introduction]`

|Acknowledgments
|"Acknowledgements"
|`[acknowledgments]`

|Executive summary [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v3.0.7]
|"Executive summary"
|`[executivesummary]`

|Scope
|"Scope"
|`[heading=scope]`

|Bibliography
|"Bibliography" or "Normative references"
|`[bibliography]`

|Terms and definitions
|"Terms and definitions"
|`[heading=terms and definitions]`

|Symbols and abbreviated terms
| "Symbols", "Abbreviated terms", "Symbols and abbreviated terms"
|`[heading=symbols and abbreviated terms]`

|Index
|"Index"
|`[index]`

|Appendix
| No standardized title
|`[appendix]`

|===


There are some restrictions on the number of sections of certain types that can
be included in a document.

For all documents:

* only one "Abstract" section is allowed
* only one "Acknowledgements" section is allowed
* only one "Executive summary" section is allowed
* only one "Index" section is allowed

In most flavours and document types:

* only one "Terms and definitions" section is allowed

For sections that are limited to one instance, if a second matching clause is found,
it is treated as a normal clause.

This behavior can be overridden by specifying the section type in a `heading`
attribute: this is interpreted as the user explicitly wanting that section type
to apply [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.10.0].
Setting `heading=clause` will suffice to ensure that a clause is treated as a normal clause.


The following example indicates usage of the section titles.

[source,adoc]
----
= Document title

== Abstract

== Foreword

[preface] <1>
== Introduction to version 3 of this standard

[bibliography] <2>
== Normative references

[heading=terms and definitions] <3>
== Terms, definitions, and abbreviations

[bibliography]
== Bibliography
...

[appendix,obligation=informative] <4>
== Additional content
...
----

<1> This section is meant to be the introduction but the title deviates from the
pre-defined title. The `[preface]` declares it as such.
<2> "Normative references" is encoded with the `[bibliography]` declaration.
<3> The "heading" declaration assigns the section as a particular kind.
<4> "Additional content" is an annex and needs to be declared explicitly.
Normative status of the annex is defined by adding the `obligation` option.

// end::tutorial[]

[NOTE]
====
The above section titles as detected by Metanorma are case-insensitive.
While ISO Directives Part 2 demands clause titles to be in
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Sentence_case[sentence case],
some organizations utilize
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Title_case[title case].

Automated title recognition (by English titles such as _Scope_, _Normative references_, etc.)
applies only at the topmost level of clause. If a clause is to be recognised with a special
type and nested at a deeper clause level, the `heading` attribute still needs to be
used [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.8.6]; otherwise,
the clauses will be treated as normal clauses, without the special semantics or formatting
of those clause types. For example,

[source,adoc]
----
== General

[heading=scope]
=== Scope

[bibliography,heading=normative references]
=== Normative references

[heading=terms and definitions]
=== Terms and definitions
----

In most flavours of Metanorma, if the title is indicated or guessed correctly,
it is overwritten by the standard title required by the SDO and internationalization;
for example, in ISO,

[source,adoc]
----
[heading=foreword]
== Fore Word
----

will still be rendered as

____
*Foreword*
____

in English, and

____
*Avant-propos*
____

in French; the supplied text is ignored.

Moreover, the title of a Terms and definitions clause will be determined automatically,
based on its contents; a `Terms and definitions` clause which contains a symbols clause
but not an abbreviated terms clause will automatically be titled _Terms, definitions and symbols_
in English (_Termes, d√©finitions et symboles_ in French.

In order to force the provided title to be retained in the clause, despite the SDO requirements
for the flavour of Metanorma, use the attribute
`keeptitle=true` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.8.6]. For example,

[source,adoc]
----
[heading=foreword,keeptitle=true]
== Fore Word
----

will be encoded and rendered as a foreword, but it will retain its title as _Fore Word_.


=== Blank subclause headings

Blank subclause headings can be given like this:

[source,asciidoc]
--
=== {blank}
--

These are used when you want to give a subclause number for a new subclause,
but without an associated header text. For example,

[source,asciidoc]
--
=== Physical and chemical characteristics

==== {blank}

The mass fraction of moisture, determined in accordance with...
--

renders as

____
*4.2. Physical and chemical characteristics*

*4.2.1.*  The mass fraction of moisture, determined in accordance with...
____

[NOTE]
====
This notation should not be used to implement paragraph numbering as required for e.g. metanorma-un.
The link:/flavors/un/[UN Metanorma flavor] treats each paragraph
as a distinct clause and automatically numbers it.
====

=== Inline headings

Inline subclause headings (e.g. for test methods) are indicated by preceding the heading
with the `[%inline-header]` option attribute. So in the Rice Model document,

[source,asciidoc]
--
[%inline-header]
==== Sieve,

with round perforations of diameter 1,4 mm.
--

renders as

____
*A.2.1.1. Sieve,* with round perforations of diameter 1,4 mm.
____

=== Variant titles

Variant titles [added in
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.5] are entered
as paragraphs with a `variant-title` role attribute within a clause, as follows:

[source,adoc]
----
=== Proper title

[.variant-title,type=sub]
This is the variant title

Text of section.
----

Variant titles of type `sub` are rendered as subtitles of clauses.

=== Floating titles

WARNING: Intended for legacy support only. Use with care.

A "`floating title`" is a title that is placed outside the numbered hierarchy of
clauses. This means that a floating title is not uniquely referable like normal
clauses.

Since the hierarchical structure of standards documents is critical to their
proper referencing, floating titles are commonly disallowed by standards
documents. Nonetheless, for legacy support reasons, floating titles are
supported in Metanoma [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.11.4]:

[source,adoc]
----
=== Section 2.1

[discrete]
==== I am a floating title within section 2.1

==== Section 2.1.1
----

NOTE: Floating titles are sometimes referred in AsciiDoc as "`discrete titles`".



== Sections deeper than 5 levels

Standards can contain many levels of embedding: ISO/IEC DIR 2 only considers
it a problem if there are more than 7 levels of embedding.

To realise higher levels of embedding,
prefix a 5-level section title with the attribute `level=`:

NOTE: Asciidoctor AsciiDoc permits only five levels of section embedding
(not counting the document title).


[source,asciidoc]
--
// Six equal signs for five levels
====== Clause 5A

[level=6]
====== Clause 6A

[level=7]
====== Clause 7A

[level=7]
====== Clause 7B

[level=6]
====== Clause 6B

====== Clause 5B
--

This generates the following ISO XML:

[source,xml]
--
<clause id="_" inline-header="false" obligation="normative">
	<title>
		Clause 5
	</title>
	<clause id="_" inline-header="false" obligation="normative">
		<title>
			Clause 6
		</title>
		<clause id="_" inline-header="false" obligation="normative">
			<title>
				Clause 7A
			</title>
		</clause>
		<clause id="_" inline-header="false" obligation="normative">
			<title>
				Clause 7B
			</title>
		</clause>
	</clause>
	<clause id="_" inline-header="false" obligation="normative">
		<title>
			Clause 6B
		</title>
	</clause>
</clause>
<clause id="_" inline-header="false" obligation="normative">
	<title>
		Clause 5B
	</title>
</clause>
--

and the rendering would be something like

*1.1.1.1.1  Clause 5A*

*1.1.1.1.1.1  Clause 6A*

1.1.1.1.1.1.1  Clause 7A

1.1.1.1.1.1.2  Clause 7B

*1.1.1.1.1.2  Clause 6B*

*1.1.1.1.2  Clause 5B*
