= Adding diagrams

The http://plantuml.com[PlantUML] diagramming tool is integrated with AsciiDoc markup
in Metanorma.

Add diagrams using a literal block with the style attribute `plantuml`, for example:

[source,asciidoctor]
--
[plantuml]
....
@startuml
Alice -> Bob: Authentication Request
Bob --> Alice: Authentication Response

Alice -> Bob: Another authentication Request
Alice <-- Bob: another authentication Response
@enduml
....
--

The integration runs PlantUML for each such block, generating a PNG image.
The images are stored in the `plantuml` directory, and linked into the output
document in place of the PlantUML.

[NOTE]
====
This requires PlantUML to be installed and available. If you installed Metanorma-CLI gem manually,
make sure to read link:/software/metanorma-cli/docs/installation/[installation notes].
