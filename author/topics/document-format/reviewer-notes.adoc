You can annotate a Metanorma AsciiDoc document with comments and `TODO`s to indicate a pending action.

[NOTE]

Reviewer notes are only rendered
if `link:/author/ref/document-attributes/#draft[:draft:]` attribute has been specified
for the document(s).

== Reviewer comments
To create a comment:

. Define the start of the comment by creating an anchor `[[start]]`.
. Define where the comment should end by creating an anchor `[[end]]` (optional). 
. Add the comments metadata: `[reviewer="Your Name",date=YYYYMMDDT0000,from=start,to=end]` +
The `date` and `to` attributes are optional. The timestamp in the `date` attribute is optional, too. The `from` and `to` elements can be bookmarks which cover no space.
. Begin the comment block using four asterisks `****`.
. Enter your comment.

== TODO expressions

Metanorma treats `TODO` as an admonition label, and converts it into a reviewer note.
The `from`, `to` `reviewer` and `date` attributes are all treated as optional.
