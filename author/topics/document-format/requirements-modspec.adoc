= ModSpec recommendations, requirements, and permissions

== General

This document describes methods used to encode OGC requirements adhering to
the https://www.ogc.org/standards/modularspec[OGC Modular Specification (ModSpec)].

The OGC ModSpec (https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3])
specifies a unified encoding through a set of UML models, describing how
requirements in OGC standards are to be treated and presented.

Metanorma for OGC provides a special syntax for the encoding and embedding of
requirements compliant to OGC ModSpec, for the exporting of machine-readable
requirements as well as ModSpec compliant rendering.

Specifically, the following models in ModSpec are supported:

* Conformance class
* Conformance test
* Requirements class
* Normative statements
** Requirement
** Recommendation
** Permission (not specified in ModSpec but allowed in
https://www.iso.org/standard/26010.html[ISO 19105],
see https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3], 4.20)

NOTE: The "`Conformance suite`", "`Conformance module`", "`Requirements module`"
models are not yet supported in Metanorma OGC. Please contact
https://www.ogc.org/projects/groups/docteam[OGC DocTeam] if support is required.

In this document, we refer to "`recommendations`", "`requirements`" and
"`permissions`" collectively using the generic term "`requirement`".

NOTE: This document supplements
link:/author/topics/document-format/requirements[Requirement, recommendation, and permission blocks]
in general Metanorma documentation.

[NOTE]
--
In some instances, the naming of terms that Metanorma uses in general is
used in Metanorma markup instead of the nomenclature used in the
https://www.ogc.org/standards/modularspec[OGC Modular Specification (ModSpec)]:

* Metanorma uses _target_ to refer to what the requirement is about, rather
than the more specific language of the ModSpec, to ensure that requirements are
represented consistently within Metanorma.

* The different types of requirement expressed by Metanorma for OGC are about
different things, and the more abstract types of requirement are about other
requirements.
--

== Understanding ModSpec

A basic understanding of ModSpec is crucial in order to understand how to encode
ModSpec-compliant models.

In simplified terms (see https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3], Annex C):

* A "`Requirement class`" consists of multiple "`Requirements`".

** All "`Requirements`" within a "`Requirement class`" are about the same
standardization target type.

* A "`Requirement`" is a condition to be satisfied by a single standardization
target type.

* A "`Conformance class`" consists of multiple "`Conformance tests`".

** A "`Conformance class`" is associated with a single corresponding
"`Requirements class`".

** Each "`Conformance test`" within the "`Conformance class`"
corresponds to a set of "`Requirements`" within the corresponding
"`Requirements class`".

* A "`Conformance test`" checks if a set of "`Requirements`" is met by a single
standardization target (an entity).

** A "`Conformance test`" has a many-to-many relation with "`Requirements`".

** A "`Conformance test`" is about a single standardization target.

** A "`Conformance test`" can be "`concrete`" or "`abstract`" depending on the
type of conformance test suite (see https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3], 6.4). A concrete conformance test is typically called as a "`conformance test`",
while an abstract conformance test is called an "`abstract test`".

* A "`Test suite`" is "`a collection of identifiable conformance classes`"
(see https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3], 6.4)

** A "`Conformance test suite`" contains only "`Conformance classes`" of the
"`concrete`" kind. Such conformance class can only contain "`concrete`"
conformance tests.

** An "`Abstract test suite`" contains only "`Conformance classes`" of the
"`abstract`" kind. Such conformance class can only contain Abstract tests.

// NOTE: In order to match the Metanorma encoding of requirements to legacy OGC
// AsciiDoc markup of requirements, users can refer to the rendering of Metanorma
// requirements which is aligned the existing, tabular OGC encoding of
// requirements.

According to the https://www.ogc.org/ogc/policies/directives[OGC Policy Directives],
OGC standards that contain requirements must have those requirements conform to
https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3].


== Encoding syntax

=== General

A requirement (in its generic meaning) is encoded via tagged example blocks
containing other tagged example blocks and open blocks.

There are two ways to encode a ModSpec model:

. Via definition lists
. Via block attributes

The definition lists method is generally recommended for its multi-line syntax
but some authors may prefer specifying attributes in the header.

WARNING: Not all attributes are supported in the block attribute syntax.
Specifically, `target`, `indirect-dependency` are not supported.

NOTE: These two methods originate from Metanorma's general support of the
alternative syntaxes for specifying a block attribute list as a definition list.
The extension of the definition lists syntax to components is specific to
Metanorma OGC.


=== Specifying using definition lists or block attributes

In Metanorma, the following two encoding syntaxes are considered equivalent.

* In the *block attributes* syntax, the necessary information is provided as an
attribute list to the block.
Values contained in the attribute list must be in plain text.

* In the *definition list* syntax, a `[%metadata]` definition list within a
ModSpec model provides the necessary information for the specified model.
Values given in the definition list syntax can be fully-formatted Metanorma
AsciiDoc text.

Attributes that can take rich textual input (Metanorma AsciiDoc input), such as
`part` and `conditions`, are components of requirements in Metanorma: these are
encoded in the block attributes syntax using the `[.component]` role within the
ModSpec model block, on open blocks or example blocks.

[example]
.Example of encoding a ModSpec requirement "part" in an open block syntax
====
[source,adoc]
----
[.component,class=part]
--
Part A of the requirement.
--
----
====

[example]
.Example of encoding a ModSpec requirement "part" in an example block syntax
======
[source,adoc]
----
[.component,class=part]
====
Part A of the requirement.
====
----
======

Conversely, in definition list syntax, not only components such as `part` and
`conditions`, but also `description` for descriptive text, can be specified
in the definition list. (In block attributes syntax, descriptive text is left
as normal text.)

The definition list may contain embedded levels [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.3];
this is needed specifically for steps embedded within a test method.

If you need to insert a cross-reference to a component, for example referencing
a specific part of a requirement elsewhere, you can only use the block
attributes sequence (as illustrated above).

The following two examples demonstrate encoding of a ModSpec requirement
that are encoded in Metanorma XML identically (and therefore rendered
identically in output).

[source,asciidoc]

====
----

These two syntaxes can be mixed.


=== ModSpec model attributes

A ModSpec model instance is encoded with one of these block types:

* `[requirement]` for Requirement
* `[recommendation]` for Recommendation
* `[permission]` for Permission
* `[requirements_class]` for Requirements class
* `[conformance_test]` for Conformance test
* `[conformance_class]` for Conformance class
* `[abstract_test]` for Abstract test

NOTE: These ModSpec types are available from [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.3]

In addition, if the Metanorma generic `[requirements]` block is used, these
values are to be used in the `type` attribute.

The following two encodings are equivalent:

[source,asciidoc]
----
[conformance_test]
----

[source,asciidoc]
----
[requirement,type=conformance_test]
----

Attributes accepted by a ModSpec instance are as follows:

`identifier`:: (mandatory) Identifier of the requirement, typically a URI. Plain text.
+
This must be unique in the document (as required by ModSpec), and is also used for referencing
and cross-linking between ModSpec instances.
+
NOTE: The `identifier` was previously encoded as `label` until
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v2.2.0 .

`subject`:: (optional) Subject that the model refers to. Plain text.

`obligation`:: (optional) Accepted values are one of:
*** `requirement` (default)
*** `recommendation`
*** `permission`

`target`:: (conditional: only for conformance-related models)
The "target" that is being tested against, specified with the identifier of the
requirement or requirements class. (Replaces `subject` in that context.)
+
NOTE: The `target` is only supported in definition list syntax. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v2.2.0]

*** When in a conformance test (or an abstract test), specify the corresponding
identifier of the requirement that is being tested.

*** When in a conformance class, specify the corresponding identifier of the
requirement class that is being tested.

// * `model` (optional when using Metanorma OGC). Type of model. The value of `ogc`
// means using OGC ModSpec models.

Differentiated types of ModSpec models allow additional attributes.

[[generalreqt]]
=== Requirement, recommendation, permission

A Requirement (or Recommendation, Permission) is encoded as a `requirement`,
`recommendation`, or `permission` block or by setting `type` to `requirement`,
`recommendation`, or `permission`.

It supports the following attributes in addition to base ModSpec attributes:

`conditions`:: (optional)
Conditions on where this requirement applies. Accepts rich text.

`part`:: (optional) A requirement can contain multiple parts of
sub-requirements. Accepts rich text. Labelled with a capital alphabetic letter.

NOTE: A part is distinct from a step (as appears in <<conftest>>): a part is a
component of a requirement, which is itself a requirement. A step is a stage in
a process of testing a requirement: it only makes sense within a test method.

`inherit`:: (optional) A requirement can inherit from one or more requirements
(_direct dependency_ in ModSpec terms).
Accepts identifiers of other requirements: multiple values are semicolon-delimited.
Can be repeated in definition list syntax.

`indirect-dependency`:: (optional) A requirement can inherit indirectly
from one or more requirement classes, which have a different standardisation target from that of the
requirement. That requirement class is used, produced, or associated with the current requirement,
but its requirements are not inherited by this requirement.
Only supported in definition list syntax. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v2.2.1]

`classification`:: (optional) Classification of this requirement.
The `classification` attribute is marked up as in the rest of Metanorma:
`key1=value1;key2=value2...`, where _value_ is either a single
string, or a comma-delimited list of values.

NOTE: `conditions`, `part` supported since [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.2].

[[reqt_class]]
=== Requirements class

A "`Requirements class`" is encoded as a block of `requirements_class` or using
`type` equals to `requirements_class`.

A Requirements class is cross-referenced and captioned as a
"`{Requirement} class {N}`" [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v0.2.11].

NOTE: Classes for Recommendations will be captioned as
"`Recommendations class {N}`", similarly for "`Requirements class {N}`" and
"`Permissions class {N}`".

Requirements classes allow the following attributes in addition to the base
ModSpec attributes:

Name:: (mandatory) Name of the requirements class should be specified as the
block caption.

`subject`:: (mandatory) The Target Type. Rendered as _Target Type_.

`inherit`:: (optional)
Dependent requirements classes. See <<generalreqt,Requirement, recommendation, permission>>.

`indirect-dependency`:: (optional)
Indirect dependent requirements classes. See <<generalreqt,Requirement, recommendation, permission>>.

Embedded requirements (optional)::
Requirements contained in a class are marked up as nested requirements.

image::/assets/author/ogc/reqt3.png[Rendering]
======

NOTE: In this example, both block attributes and definition list syntax is used;
the `inherit` attribute has two values, which are expressed in the definition list.

// TODO: Add rendering example

A requirements class can contain multiple requirements, specified with embedded
requirements.

The contents of these embedded requirements may be specified within the
requirements class, or specified outside of the requirements class (referenced
using the identifier). If the requirement is specified within a definition list,
the definition list value is interpreted as the requirement identifier.

=== Conformance class

Specified by setting the block as `conformance_class` or by using `type` as
`conformance_class`.

A Conformance class is cross-referenced and captioned as
"`Conformance class {N}`", and is otherwise rendered identically to a
"`Requirements class`" [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.0.4].

Conformance classes support the following attributes in addition to base ModSpec
attributes:

`target`:: (mandatory) Associated Requirements class. Populated with the identifier of the
Requirements class. Rendered as _Requirements Class_.

`inherit`:: (optional) Dependencies of the conformance class. Accepts multiple
values, which are the identifiers of other requirements.
See <<generalreqt,Requirement, recommendation, permission>>.

`indirect-dependency`:: (optional) Indirect dependent requirements classes. See
<<generalreqt,Requirement, recommendation, permission>>.

Conformance classes also feature:

Name:: (optional) Specified as the block caption.

Nesting:: (optional) Conformance tests contained in a conformance class are
encoded as conformance tests within the conformance class block.
See <<reqt_class,Requirements class>>.

NOTE: Conformance classes do not have a Target Type (as specified in ModSpec).
If one must be encoded, it should be encoded as a classification key-value
pair.

[[conftest]]
=== Conformance test and Abstract test

A "`Conformance test`" can be "`concrete`" or "`abstract`" depending on the type
of conformance test suite (see https://portal.ogc.org/files/?artifact_id=34762[OGC 08-131r3], 6.4).

The OGC author should identify whether a standard requires an "`Abstract test
suite`" or a "`Conformance test suite`" in order to decide the encoding of
"`Conformance tests`" (concrete tests) versus "`Abstract tests`".

* A conformance test is specified by creating a `conformance_test` block or
using `type` as `conformance_test`.
It is cross-referenced as "`Conformance test {N}`"

* An abstract test is specified by creating an `abstract_test` block or using
`type` as `abstract_test`, or `conformance_test` together with
`abstract=true`.
It is cross-referenced as "`Abstract test {N}`" [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.0.4].

// NOTE: Verifications for Recommendations will be captioned as
// Recommendation Tests, similarly for Requirement Tests and
// Permission Tests.

Conformance tests support the following attributes and components in addition to
base ModSpec attributes:

`target`:: The associated requirement. Populated with the identifier of the requirement.
Multiple semicolon-delimited values may be provided. Rendered as _Requirement_.

`inherit`:: (optional) Dependencies. Accepts multiple values, which are the identifiers
of other requirements.  See <<generalreqt,Requirement, recommendation, permission>>.
* `indirect-dependency` (optional). Indirect dependent requirements classes. See <<generalreqt,Requirement, recommendation, permission>>.

Components:: (optional) Components of the conformance test. Accepts rich
text. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.0].
Allows the following classes:

`test-purpose`::: (optional) Purpose of the test. Rich text. Presented as _Test
Purpose_ [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.2]

`test-method`::: (optional) Method of the test. Rich text. Presented as _Test
Method_ [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.2]

`step`::: (optional) Step of the test method. Is expected to be embedded within `test-method`,
and may contain substeps of its own. Rich text. Presented as a numbered list.
added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.2].
+
Steps can be nested, the nested list order is: _arabic_, then _alphabetic_, then
_roman_.

`test-method-type`::: (optional) Method of the test. Rich text. Presented as
_Test Method Type_ [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.3]

`reference`::: (optional) Purpose of the test. Rich text. Presented as _Reference_.

Test type:: The test type of a Conformance test is encoded as a `classification` key-value pair.


Conformance tests also feature:

* Name (optional). Specified as the requirement's block caption.

NOTE: Conformance Tests are excluded from the "`Table of Requirements`" in Word
output [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v0.2.10].

== Rendering of ModSpec models

OGC ModSpec models are rendered in a table format.

NOTE: This rendering method is consistent with prior OGC practice.

* For HTML rendering, the CSS class of the ModSpec specification table is the
`type` attribute of the requirement.
+
--
The following types are recognised:

** No value for Requirements
** `conformance_test` for Conformance tests
** `abstract_test` for Abstract tests
** `requirements_class` for Requirements classes
** `conformance_class` for Conformance classes

The default CSS class currently assigned for HTML rendering is `recommend`.
--

* The heading of the table (spanning two columns) is its name (the role
or style of the requirement, e.g. `[permission]` or `[.permission]`), optionally
followed by its title (the caption of the requirement, e.g. `.Title`).

* The title of the table (spanning two columns) is its `identifier` attribute.

* The initial rows of the body of the table give metadata about the requirement.
They include:

** The `obligation` attribute of the requirement, if given: _Obligation_
followed by the attribute value

** The `subject` attribute of the requirement, if given: _Subject_, followed by the attribute.
The subject attribute can be marked up as a cross-reference
to another requirement given in the same document. If there are multiple values of the subject,
they are semicolon delimited [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.4].

** The `inherit` attribute of the requirement, if given: _Dependency_ followed
by the attribute value. If there are multiple values of the attribute,
they are semicolon delimited.

** The `indirect-dependency` attribute of the requirement, if given:
_Indirect Dependency_ followed by the attribute value. If there are multiple
values of the attribute, they are semicolon delimited.

** The `classification` attributes of the requirement, if given: the
classification tag (in capitals), followed by the classification value.

* The remaining rows of the requirement are the remaining components of the
requirement, encoded as table rows instead of as a definition table (as they are
by default in Metanorma).

** These include the explicit `component` components of the
requirement [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v1.4.0],
which capture internal components of the requirement defined in ModSpec.
+
These are divided into two categories:

*** Components with a `class` attribute other than `part` are
extracted in order, with the class name normalised (title case), followed by the component contents.
So a component with a `class` attribute of `conditions` will be rendered as
_Conditions_ followed by the component contents. In the foregoing, we have seen components defined
in ModSpec: `test-purpose, test-method, test-method-type, conditions, reference`. However the block attribute
syntax allows open-ended component names.

*** Components with the `class` attribute `part` are extracted and presented in
order: each Part is rendered as an incrementing capital letter (_A_, _B_, _C_
and so on), followed by the component contents. Any cross-references to part components
will automatically be labelled with the identifier of their parent requirement, followed by their ordinal
letter.

** Components can include descriptive text (`description`), which is interleaved with
other components.

** Components can include open blocks marked with role attributes. That includes the
legacy Metanorma components:

*** `[.specification]`
*** `[.measurement-target]`
*** `[.verification]`
*** `[.import]`


== Legacy usage

=== Legacy Metanorma OGC AsciiDoc syntax

For legacy reasons, a second Metanorma OGC AsciiDoc syntax is permitted for
recommendations, requirements and permissions.

In this syntax, Metanorma AsciiDoc tables are used to express the
data needed for requirements:

* Type of requirement. Specified in the first table cell,
  one of `Recommendation`, `Requirement` or `Permission`.

** Optionally followed by a number
  (which is ignored in parsing; the elements are renumbered automatically in
  rendering.)

* Internal label. First paragraph of the second table cell.

* Body of requirement. Second and subsequent paragraphs of the second table cell.

----
[[recommendation1]]
|===
|Recommendation |/ogc/recommendation/wfs/2 +

If the API definition document uses the OpenAPI Specification 3.0,
the document SHOULD conform to the
<<rc_oas30,OpenAPI Specification 3.0 requirements class>>.
|===
----
====

=== Legacy ModSpec type keywords

These values for the ModSpec model type have been deprecated:

* `general` for Requirement, Recommendation or Permission (now `requirement`, `recommendation` or `permission`)
* `class` for Requirements class (now `requirements_class`)
* `verification` for Conformance test (now `conformance_test`)
* `conformanceclass` for Conformance class (now `conformance_class`)
* `abstracttest` for Abstract test (now `abstract_test`)
