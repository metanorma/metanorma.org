= Cross-references

== General

Cross-references are realized in Metanorma AsciiDoc by assigning an anchor
to the block to be referenced, and writing a cross-reference containing
that anchor ID:

[source,adoc]
--
[[anchor-id]]
= Target clause

The requirements are...

= Reference clause

As seen in <<anchor-id>>...
--

WARNING: See <<text-ref-allowed-anchors>> for allowed characters in anchor IDs.

NOTE: Cross-reference text in Metanorma adheres to guidance given in
ISO/IEC DIR 2 for internal cross-references, in order to guarantee
unambiguous referencing.

In particular, if a formula, example, figure, list, list item or table is cross-referenced
outside its (sub)clause, the clause containing the item is always given in the cross-reference,
unless the item is being referenced in the same clause.

In the case of notes, the containing clause is extended to containing example, figure or table.

[example]
====
For example, in the Metanorma ISO Rice model sample document
formula B.1 is defined in Annex B.6, and is referenced in B.6 and B.7.

In the Rice model document published by ISO, both instances are cited as "`Formula (B.1)`".
However, Metanorma follows ISO/IEC DIR 2 in citing the former
as "`Formula (B.1)`", but the latter as "`B.6, Formula (B.1)`".

In this sense, Metanorma is "`more royalist than the king`" in applying formatting rules and
validationâ€”which is what you would want of a computer-based tool.
====

The label of the item cross-referenced, the use of brackets, and the containing reference
are all taken care of by Metanorma; the document author needs only give the item identifier
in the AsciiDoc source
(e.g. `\<<``formulaB-1``>>` generates either "`Formula (B.1)`" or "`B.6, Formula (B.1)`",
depending on where in the document it occurs.)

[[xref-styles]]
== Cross-reference styles

Metanorma supports multiple cross-reference styles [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.2.6].

NOTE: The document attribute `:xrefstyle:` applies the same setting as a
document default.

The following cross-reference styles are available:

`short`::: (default) the clause type and number is used as the cross-reference.
+
.Example of a cross-reference rendered in the "short" style
[example]
"Clause 3.1.2"

`basic`::: the title of the clause is used as the cross-reference.
+
.Example of a cross-reference rendered in the "basic" style
[example]
"Other considerations"

`full`::: combines the title with the clause type/number cross-reference.
+
.Example of a cross-reference rendered in the "full" style
[example]
"Clause 3.1.2, Other considerations"

`id`::: the cross-reference is to be rendered as the target anchor identifier
(or any identifier aliasing the
anchor) [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.2.7].
+
.Example of a cross-reference rendered in the "id" style
[example]
====
"/req/crs/crs-uri", where `/req/crs/crs-uri` is an identifier of the referenced object.
====

These cross-reference styles can be specified at the individual cross-references
by using the following syntax:

[source,adoc]
----
<<LOCATOR,style={STYLE}%>>
----

Where,

* `LOCATOR` is the locator, which could be an anchor;
* `STYLE` is one of the cross-reference styles codes.

.Example of a cross-reference rendered in the basic style
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
<<anchor,style=basic%>>
----
====

.Example of a cross-reference rendered in the short style
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
<<anchor,style=short%>>
----
====

.Example of a cross-reference rendered in the full style
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
<<anchor,style=full%>>
----
====

.Example of a cross-reference rendered in the "id" style
[example]
====
The following cross-reference:

[source,adoc]
----
[[my-anchor]]
=== My title
...

=== Another place
<<my-anchor,style=id%>>
----

Renders the cross-reference as:

"my-anchor"
====


[[combined-xrefs]]
== Combination of cross-references

It is possible to combine multiple cross-references into a single expression,
which will be internationalised as
appropriate [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.0.4].

Multiple cross-references are separated by `;`.

Conjunctives recognised between cross-references are:

* `and` (clauses A and B)
* `or` (clauses A or B)
* `from` and `to` (clauses from A to B)

These conjunctives are prefixed to the cross-reference anchor, separated by `!`.

[example]
.Example of rendering a continuous locality range
====
[source,adoc]
----
<<context;to!improvement>>
----

rendered as

____
Clauses 7 to 9
____
====

[example]
.Example of rendering a disjoint locality range
====
[source,adoc]
----
<<context;and!improvement>>
----

rendered as

____
Clauses 7 and 9
____
====

Of the connectives, `from` and `to` are presumed to nest more closely than `and`
or `or`, and there is no provision for complex nesting.

If a connective is left out before `to`, `from` is presupposed; otherwise, `and`
is presupposed.

Sequences of more than two cross-references all logically joined by `and` should
be separated with `;` with no commas:

* `<<clause3;table2>>` means "clause 3, and table 2"

Commas in the encoding of references indicates separation of subreference:

* `<<clause3,table2>>` means "table 2 within clause 3"

Continuous and disjoint localities can be used together.

[example]
.Example of rendering continuous and discontinuous locality ranges in the same cross-reference
====
[source,adoc]
----
<<clause3_2;clause4_6;clause4_7;clause9>>
// or
<<clause3_2;and!clause4_6;and!clause4_7;and!clause9>>
----

Renders as:

____
clause 3.2, 4.6, 4.7 and 9
____
====


== Cross-references without labels and prefixes

If the cross-reference is given with `droploc%` as its text, then the label and
prefix are dropped: the cross-reference value is given in
isolation [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.5.4].

This can be done for example for ranges, as follows.

.Example of cross-reference without labels and prefixes
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
Clauses <<context,droploc%>> to <<improvement,droploc%>>
----

renders as:

____
Clauses 7 to 9
____
====

== Custom cross-reference labels and prefixes

To insert a custom label for a cross-reference, as opposed to the label specific
to the content and following the rules for that kind of content, use the syntax
`label=...%` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.8.6].

The label should appear as it will rendered, including with the right
capitalisation.

NOTE: This is almost *always* a violation of SDO style, and is not recommended.

.Example of rendering a subclause reference with custom prefix "Subclause"
[example]
====
You could change "Clause" to "Subclause" instead of what is expected for a
subclause by Metanorma for ISO (whether _Clause 7.9_ or just _7.9_).

[source,asciidoc]
----
<<context,label=Subclause%>>
----

to be rendered as

____
Subclause 7.9
____
====

NOTE: This approach changes only the label of the item being pointed to. If the
Metanorma flavour qualifies the cross-reference with a reference to its
container, e.g. _Clause 5 Note 2_, `label` will only alter the label of the item
(_Note_), and not that of its container (_Clause_).


[[text-ref-allowed-anchors]]
== Anchor ID syntax

Anchor IDs of any type (cross-references, items, bibliographies, etc.) are
ultimately converted into XML, and therefore *should not* contain the following:

* colons;
* whitespaces or;
* words starting with numbers.

These cases are not supported in XML; permitted characters are specified by the
link:https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/#NT-NCName[NCName attribute for Namespace Declaration].

If such an anchor ID is found in a Metanorma document, it will be left alone in
Semantic XML [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v3.0.8],
and errors will be reported against the anchor ID unaltered. However, the anchor will be
sanitised in Presentation XML, so that it does not violate the NCName requirements.

Colons in cross-references are used for
link:/author/topics/collections/cross-referencing/#indirect-xrefs[indirect cross-references between files in the same collection],
to delimit namespaces and containers from anchor IDs [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.4].

== Differences between anchors and content identifiers

In Metanorma Semantic XML, a distinction is made between user-supplied anchors
for elements (`@anchor`), and content identifiers
(`@id`) [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v3.0.8].

Anchor attributes appear on elements only when supplied by the user, and are the
targets of any cross-references. So long as the user does not edit them in the
source, they will remain the same, and they are intended for use as element
locators.

NOTE: Metanorma also automatically assigns anchors for all terms, to be used in
cross-references from
link:author/topics/sections/concepts/#citeterms[concept mentions].
These are derived from the term designation.

There is also a requirement that all block- and clause-level elements have an
identifier which can be referenced for document processing in Metanorma, whether
the user has supplied a value or not. This is generated by Metanorma as an
auto-generated content identifier. Auto-generated identifiers in Metanorma have
the form of a GUID, prefixed with `_`; e.g. `_01234567-89ab-cdef-0123-456789abcdef`.

In order to keep anchors stable within a single version of the document,
Metanorma calculates those GUIDs as an MD5 Hash of the XPath of the element, followed by
its text content [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.8].

So long as neither the text content nor the position in the document of the
entity changes, an entity will retain the same content identifier.

In Presentation XML, the content identifier is preserved as `@semx-id`. The
attribute `@id` is used as the element anchor, and is the NCNname-normalised
counterpart to `@anchor`, if supplied; if `@anchor` is not supplied, the value
of `@semx-id` is used. That means that all elements with content identifiers can
be cross-referenced in Presentation XML, not just those elements with
user-supplied anchors.

[[anchor-aliasing]]
== Anchor aliasing

It is possible to use more than one string to be used as an anchor for the same
element.

This is useful particularly for Linked Data documents, where a URI is treated as
the identifier of a document block or term, and the URI is used to reference
that document element: Metanorma AsciiDoc and XML syntax both prevent URIs from
being used themselves as document anchors.

In order to specify the aliases of anchors manually, you will need to specify a
table with anchor `_misccontainer_anchor_aliases` under the
(link:/author/topics/sections/extension-container/[`metanorma-extension` clause]) [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.2.7].

Each row of that table will have the anchor as its first cell, and aliases of
the anchor as the other cells; there can be more than one alias of an anchor.

== Localities

Normally in AsciiDoc, any text in a cross-reference that follows a comma
constitutes custom text for the cross-reference.

So a cross-reference `\<<ISO7301,the foregoing reference>>`
would be rendered as "`the foregoing reference`", and hyperlinked to the
`ISO7301` reference.

In Metanorma AsciiDoc cross-references, bibliographic localities
(e.g. page numbers, clause numbers) can be added directly after the comma,
as part of the cross-reference text.

NOTE: This differs from the normal AsciiDoc treatment of custom text.

[example]
.Example of setting a series of localities
====
"`ISO 7301, Clause 2, Table 1a, pp. 7-9`" would be expressed as:

[source,adoc]
--
<<ISO7301,clause=2,table=1a,page=7-9>>
--
====

See link:/author/topics/inline_markup/citations#localities[localities and locality values].

== List items

List items can be cross-referenced by inserting a bookmark at the very start of
the list item:

[source,adoc]
--
. Ordered list
.. [[id1]] This is the first list item
... [[id2]] This is a list sub-item
--

== Definition list terms

Definition list terms can be cross-referenced by inserting a bookmark at the
very start
of the term [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.0]:

[source,adoc]
--
[[id1]]Term 1:: Definition
[[id2]]Term 2::: Another Definition
--

== Inline elements

An anchor can be specified to refer to various locations:

* on a block
* as a standalone inline element with no textual content (a bookmark)
* at a span of text within a block, using the command `anchor:{anchor}[text]` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v3.0.9]:

[source,adoc]
----
[[block-anchor]]
|===
| [[bookmark]] This is a cell that is not pointed to by the bookmark anchor.
| anchor:ABC[*this is some text referenced by ABC*]
|===

<<block-anchor,This cross-reference points to the entire table>>

<<bookmark,This cross-reference points to the bookmark preceding the text "This is a cell...", but not to the text itself>>

<<ABC,This cross-reference points to the boldface text span "This is some text referenced by ABC">>
----


== Source anchor tracers

WARNING: This demonstrates advanced knowledge of Metanorma and its model
rendering capabilities.

Metanorma XML preserves the links between different representations of the same
source data wherever possible, to establish traceability.

This is particulary important when connecting a serialisation of external data,
stored in `metanorma-extension`, to a Metanorma XML representation of that data.

Metanorma provides the command `source-id:{anchor}[text]` in order to establish
such connections, particulary in the Lutaml processing of external data into
Metanorma XML. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v3.0.9]

This command wraps `text` (as a serialisation of external data) in a `span`
element with the `@source` attribute `anchor`, which corresponds to an `@anchor`
identifier inserted in the serialisation of that source data.

[example]
====
Suppose there is a LutaML serialisation of the `widget` model that is being
rendered into a Metanorma document.

In order to trace the `widget` model attributes in an external model, with value `ABC`, the
external model is serialized under metanorma-extension with a defined anchor, say as
`<widget anchor="11214">ABC</widget>`.

Then the Metanorma representation of that attribute is mapped back to the
serialisation with the expression `source-id:11214[ABC]`, which is realised in
Metanorma XML as `<span source="11214">ABC</span>`, where `11214` is used as the
cross-reference binding the two together.

This allows the final serialized representation of the `widget` model back to its
original external model source.
====

If `source-id:{anchor}[]` is used with empty text, the `@source` attribute is
assigned instead to the XML element containing the command.

[example]
====
The following assigns `@source = "11214"` to the note containing the command.

[source,adoc]
----
NOTE: This is a note source-id:11214[]
----
====


== Hyperlinks

Hyperlinks to URIs can have alt text, which is used in accessibility
(corresponding to the HTML `a@title` attribute).

This is specified by appending `,title=...` after the text in the URL macro in
Metanorma AsciiDoc:

[example]
====
[source,adoc]
--
http://www.example.com[text to go into the hyperlink]

http://www.example2.com[text to go into the second hyperlink,title=This is a tooltip for the link]
--
====

Hyperlinks can also have a rendering style set with a flavour-specific
value [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.8.1];
this option is currently only used in IETF.

This is specified by appending `,style=...` after the text in the URL command:

[example]
====
[source,adoc]
--
http://www.example.com[style=brackets]

http://www.example2.com[text to go into the hyperlink,style=brackets]
--
====

== External references

In link:/author/topics/inline_markup/citations#localities[localities and locality values],
anchor can be integrated in citations of documents via references.

[example]
.Example of referencing an anchor in a cross-referenced document
====
The following code:

[source,adoc]
--
<<ISO7301,anchor=xyz>>
--

will generate a hyperlink to the element with ID `xyz` in document `ISO7301`.
====

This convention is necessary for cross-references between documents in a
Metanorma document collection.

Outside of that, Metanorma will process cross-references to anchors within
external documents just like typical AsciiDoc.

[example]
.Example of referencing an anchor in an external document
====
The following code:

[source,adoc]
--
<<document1.adoc#b>>
--

will be processed as a link to anchor `#b` in document `document1.adoc`.
====

If the reference uses the `.adoc` suffix, as in the example above, it is
stripped in Metanorma XML and substituted with the extension of the current
document type during document generation.

The above example is rendered in Metanorma XML as `<xref target="document1#b">`,
in HTML as `<a href="document1.html#b">`, and in PDF as
`<a href="document1.pdf#b">`.
