== Concepts, designations, terms and definitions

=== General

In many standards organizations, a dedicated "Terms and definitions" section is
included in their documents in order to provide a local dictionary containing
definitions for terms used within a document.

This dictionary can be considered a "concept collection" or a "concept
dictionary".

Some organizations allow the specification of more than one "terms and
definitions" section, for example, in order to separate normative and
informative concepts.

There are multiple possibilities when managing these concepts:

* all concepts are defined locally in the document;

* some concepts are locally defined while some are externally sourced

* all concepts are sourced from one or more external entries
  (e.g. a termbase, a document)

Working with a concept collection within Metanorma requires understanding
the following topics that are explained below:

. How to work with a concept collection;

. How to work with individual concepts.


=== Working with a concept collection

==== Basics

To create a concept collection, commonly understood as a "terms and definitions
section" within Metanorma, all you need is to apply the correct title for a
section heading. Metanorma will be able to insert that in the correct location
in the resulting document.

Take ISO for example, its "`Terms and definitions`" clause is always at
Clause 3 according to the ISO DIR 2.
Regardless where the "Terms and definitions" clause is defined, it will always
be rendered at Clause 3.

.Creating a terms and definitions clause in Metanorma ISO
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
== Terms and Definitions
--

renders as

____
*3. Terms and definitions*

ISO and IEC maintain terminological databases for use in
standardization at the following addresses:

* ISO Online browsing platform: available at http://www.iso.org/obp[]
* IEC Electropedia: available at http://www.electropedia.org[]
____
====

Notice that in Metanorma ISO, there is predefined text that is automatically
generated, not entered by the user. This is also the case for many standards
bodies that specify rules for document structure.


==== Clause title

A terms and definitions clause will be recognized if either title below is given
regardless of case:

* _Terms and definitions_;
* _Terms, definitions and symbols_;
* _Terms, definitions and abbreviated terms_; or
* _Terms, definitions, symbols and abbreviated terms_

NOTE: This behavior differs across standard flavors; please refer to specific
documentation for a particular flavor.

It is recommended to use the "_Terms and definitions_" title for the clause
heading regardless of the content contained -- Metanorma will automatically
render the correct clause title. This is demonstrated in <<clause-title-example>>.

NOTE: The same clause title can be repeated as a subclause without negative
effects (see <<clause-title-example>>).

[[clause-title-example]]
[example]
.Automatic generation of "Terms and definitions" title depending on content
====
This encoding:

[source,adoc]
----
== Terms and definitions

=== Terms and definitions

==== beef

...

=== Abbreviated terms

foo:: bar
----

Will generate the following structure with the correct clause title:

____
*3* Terms, definitions and abbreviated terms

*3.1* Terms and definitions

*3.1.1* beef
...

*3.2* Abbreviated terms

foo: bar
____
====

Automated titles will only be generated if the terms & definitions clause
and its immediate children are exhaustively covered by the possibilities above:
each child element is either a definitions clause or a terms collection, or initial
boilerplate text, and there is only one of each type or combination of types.
If there are other clauses mixed in, or if there are multiple collections of terms,
Metanorma will not replace the terms, because its replacements will likely not be true;
for example, if there are two subclauses containing terms, no one subclause should be
named "Terms and definitions" [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.6.2].

To force an override this behaviour, and retain the terms and definitions title as given,
use the `keeptitle=true` attribute [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.8.6].

[[source]]
==== Concept source

If the concepts of a standard are partly or fully sourced from an external
document or collection, that external item is cited in a `source` attribute
to the section.

The syntax to apply one or more concept sources is as follows:

[source,adoc]
----
[source=REFERENCE_ANCHOR]
== Terms and definitions
----

Where the `REFERENCE_ANCHOR` is the reference anchor of the cited item.
The definition of this cited reference item is typically entered under the
"Normative references" clause.

NOTE: The `source` attribute needs to be applied to the top-level clause, if
there are subclauses.

Any predefined text of the terms and definitions section is adjusted
accordingly.

.Setting ISO 712 as a terminology source for the concepts collection
[example]
====

Multiple sources are allowed. The sources are to be quoted into a single value,
and delimited by commas.

====

==== Predefined text / Boilerplate

===== Location of predefined text

The "`terms and definitions`" clause is often prefixed with _predefined text_
automatically before any terms are listed.

Such predefined text typically serve the following purposes:

* indicate provenance of definitions (see <<source>>); and
* provide the location where definitions may be consulted,
  depending on the flavour.

NOTE: For ISO documents, a reference to the ISO Online Browsing Platform and to the
IEC Electropedia is provided in the predefined text.

The predefined text, by default, is placed in the first clause that either
contains terms, or is titled as a terms collection.

If a clause contains a terms collection, but is not titled as one, the
predefined text moves down to the terms collection; that is to deal with terms
collections contained in miscellaneous clauses which contain both terms and
extraneous
content [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.8.12].

In ISO-based flavours, the predefined text is placed as above, but not in a
clause that contains both terms collections and symbols or abbreviations.

===== Appending to predefined text

Any paragraphs or lists found where the predefined text should go
are appended to the flavour's defined predefined text, in the
intermediate XML format [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.0].

NOTE: Behavior prior to release `metanorma-standoc` 1.7.0 was for any such text
to be overwritten by the flavour's defined predefined text.

In the following example the Metanorma ISO flavor is used to demonstrate the
behavior.

Input:

[example]
.Appended predefined text
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
== Terms and definitions

This is some random text I have inserted in this document.

* It does not follow ISO requirements
* Nor does it follow IEC requirements

=== Term 1
--

In the rendering, the text between the title and the first
term definition is appended to the predefined text required by ISO:

____
*3. Terms and definitions*

ISO and IEC maintain terminological databases for use in
standardization at the following addresses:

* ISO Online browsing platform: available at http://www.iso.org/obp[]
* IEC Electropedia: available at http://www.electropedia.org[]

This is some random text I have inserted in this document.

* It does not follow ISO requirements
* Nor does it follow IEC requirements

*3.1 Term 1*
____
====


===== Overriding predefined text

If there are no terms and definitions from the document,
no terms should be included in the clause body (it should be blank).
The predefined text at the start of the clause is adjusted to
reflect both possibilities.

In order to replace (override) the predefined text with custom
content, an initial open block with the style attribute
`[.boilerplate]` can be used to do
so [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.3.0].

(Formerly, a clause with that style
attribute [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.0].)

Input:

[example]
.Overridden predefined text
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
== Terms and definitions

[.boilerplate]
--
This is predefined text that overwrites the default.

* No, it does not follow ISO requirements
* And no, it does not follow IEC requirements either
--

=== Term 1
----

Where:

* The custom predefined text is encoded as a subclause, so that
  its extent can be made unambiguous in initial processing.

The example above will be rendered as:

.Rendering of overriden predefined text
____
*3. Terms and definitions*

This is predefined text that overwrites the default.

* No, it does not follow ISO requirements
* And no, it does not follow IEC requirements either

*3.1 Term 1*
____
====


===== Emptying predefined text

If you want to prevent the default predefined text from
appearing, you can do so by providing an empty
predefined text open block.

[example]
.Emptying predefined text
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
== Terms and definitions

[.boilerplate]
--
--

=== Term 1
--
====


===== Moving predefined text

To move the default predefined text elsewhere from where Metanorma calculates it
should be, set the content of the boilerplate block as `(default)`

The `(default)` text will be overwritten with the correct predefined text, and
that text will not appear
elsewhere [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.8.12].

=== Methodology
----
=====


==== Subclauses

===== Concept grouping subclauses

Any clause within a "`Terms and definitions`" section which is a non-terminal
subclause (has child nodes) is automatically considered a terms (or definitions)
section.

On the other hand, any descendant of a `nonterm` clause is also a `nonterm`
clause.

Informative clauses are indicated with the attribute `[obligation=informative]`;
clauses are normative by default.

===== Introductory non-term clause

All terminal subclauses of a term section (i.e. clauses that have no subclauses
of their own) are treated as term definitions.

We have already seen one exception to this, in `[.boilerplate]` clauses. More
generally, an introductory section can be treated as a subclause instead of a
term (and will retain its status as a subclause), by prefixing it with the style
attribute `[.nonterm]`:

[example]

For the purposes of this document, the following terms from
ISO 10303-11 apply.

.Inclusion of non-term subclauses using the `[.nonterm]` attribute
image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/fig-terms-non-clause-section.png[Inclusion of non-term subclauses]
====


The `[.nonterm]` attribute must only be used in subclauses that do
not contain any terms underneath (like the example above).
Otherwise, these terms will not be processed following the
corresponding formatting rules.

.Non-term attribute wrongly applied to a term-containing subclause

=== Working with individual concepts

==== General

Concepts entered within "`terms and definitions`" sections follow a strict data
input scheme:

* The term is given as a *subheading* at the appropriate level
  (three equal signs, unless there are subsections in the "`Terms and definition`"
  section). That subheading has as its content a preferred designation for the term
  (<<designations>>).

* The term is followed by other designations:

** preferred (`+preferred:[...]+`);
** admitted (`+admitted:[...]+` or `+alt:[...]+`); and
** deprecated (`+deprecated:[...]+`).

* The term is optionally followed by *related terms*, which are marked up with
  `+related:[...]+` commands. These are cross-references that are expected to be
  defined elsewhere, by contrast with the other designations, which are defined
  within the current entry.

* The term can also be followed by other metadata, including the
  term *domain*, which must be marked up in a `+domain:[...]+` command.
  Much of this metadata is formatted through a `%metadata` definition list
  (see <<metadata>>).

* The *definition* of the term is given in a separate paragraph.

* The definition is optionally followed by *examples*
  (paragraphs with an `[example]` style attribute).

* The definition is then optionally followed by *notes* (denoted with a `NOTE:`
  prefix).

* The definition is then followed by a *citation* for the term
  (marked with a `[.source]` role attribute).

* The *source* is a citation cross-reference to a normative reference,
  optionally followed by a comma and a modification if applicable.
  If the comma is appended without text, then the term will be shown as
  modified, with no specific modification.

NOTE: A term can be cross-referenced from other terms, through the smart terms
reference mechanism or by assigning an *anchor*.

==== Domain and subject

Domain and subject apply to concepts as described in ISO 10241-1.

Concepts can be provided with extended metadata in a definition list,
after the term subheading, marked with the option attribute
`[%metadata]` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.11.0].

The following keys are allowed:

`domain`:: The domain of the term
`subject`:: The subject of the term

[[designations]]
==== Designations

===== General

A *designation* is the cover term for names of concepts that are included in
terms.

It covers:

* the _preferred_ name (displayed as the heading for the term);
* the _alternative_ or _admitted_ names (specified as `admitted:[...]` or `alt:[...]`), and
* the _deprecated_ names (specified as `deprecated:[...]`).


===== Preferred designations

The first preferred designation is specified as a section heading under
the "`Terms and definitions`" clause.

[example]
.A single preferred designation
====
[source,adoc]
----
== Terms and definitions

=== application

one or more processes creating or using product data
----
====

Metanorma allows specifying multiple preferred
designations [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.11.0].

Each designation in Metanorma AsciiDoc must appear in its own paragraph.

NOTE: Some standards bodies do not allow multiple preferred designations.

The `preferred:[...]` command can be used to specify additional designations for
the second and subsequent designations.

By default, they will be rendered in the same term title as the first preferred
designation, delimited by semicolons.

[example]
.Applying multiple preferred designations
====
[source,adoc]
----
== Terms and definitions

=== application
preferred:[app]

one or more processes creating or using product data
----
====

Duplicate designations under the same term of the same type are removed, with
a warning [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.4.8];
e.g. the section heading "application" followed by `preferred:[application]`.

===== Admitted designations

Admitted designations, also called alternative designations, are entered using
the command `admitted:[...]` (or `alt:[...]`).

[example]
.Example from ISO 10303-2
====
[source,adoc]
----
=== application interpreted model
admitted:[AIM]

information model that includes the application constructs necessary to satisfy
the requirements of an application reference model
----
====

Admitted designations are distinct from preferred designations, in that the use of any
of the preferred designations is recommended over any of the admitted designations.
Normally there is only one preferred designation per term, and any other designations
are treated as admitted. Multiple preferred designations are however allowed
in cases where they are useful, for instance, in representing multiple
equivalent symbols.

===== Deprecated designations

Deprecated designations are entered using the `deprecated:[...]` command.

[example]
.Example from ISO 10303-2
====
[source,adoc]
----
=== business object model
deprecated:[BO Model]

single integrated information model for the scope of an AP
----
====


[[metadata]]
===== Designation metadata

Metadata about designations can be given in a definition list,
_immediately after the definition of the designation_
(including the term subheading), marked with option attribute
`[%metadata]` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.11.0].

The following keys are supported:

`language`:: the language of the designation. Specified as an ISO 639-* code.

`script`:: the script of the designation. Specified as an ISO 15924 code.

`field-of-application`:: text indicating the field of application of the designation (typically the domain),
and used to disambiguate from other designations identical in the current language.
The "field of application" in ISO/IEC appears in angle brackets, after the designation
itself [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.11.2].
+
--
[example]
.IEV 102-05-28 designation (from ISO/IEC DIR IEC SUP:2021 SK.5)
====
Laplacian, <of a scalar field>
====

[example]
.IEV 102-03-22 designation
====
component, <of a vector quantity>
====

NOTE: The "`field of application`" refers to the IEC terminology attribute of
"`specific use`", which contrasts against the ISO use of "`domain`".
While they are similar in subtle ways, the "`domain`" applies to a concept, where
"`specific use`" applies to a designation.
The concept "specific use" is used in IEC, heavily within IEV (the IEC 60050
series); it is not used in ISO.

NOTE: Refer to https://www.iec.ch/members_experts/refdocs/[ISO/IEC Directives, IEC Supplement:2021], Annex SK "Rules for terminology work",
for more information on "`specific use`". Further details are also available in ISO 10241-1.
--

`usage-info`:: usage information, which is text used to disambiguate the
designation from other designations identical in the current language,
but not relating to the field of application of the designation. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.11.2].

on the usage of "`usage information`". Further details can be found in ISO 10241-1.
--

`geographic-area`:: the geographic area of the designation. Specified as an ISO 3166-1 code.

`type`:: type of expression used as designation; supported values are

*** `prefix`
*** `suffix`
*** `abbreviation`
*** `full`

`isInternational`:: designation is valid across languages and country; value is
boolean (`true` or `false`)

`abbreviation-type`:: type of abbreviation used; supported values are:

*** `truncation`
*** `acronym`
*** `initialism`

`pronunciation`:: guide to pronunciation for designation; accepts a string value

`absent`:: the designation is absent; value is boolean (`true` or `false`)

`letter-symbol`:: the designation is not a linguistic expression, but a letter,
symbol, formula, or equation; value is boolean (`true` or `false`), or else [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.7.2]
one of `letter`, `symbol`, `formula`, `equation`.


Grammar of the designation is encoded as keys within the tag `grammar`:

`grammar`::

`gender`::: the gender of the designation. Multiple values are allowed,
comma-delimited. Supported values are:

**** `masculine`
**** `feminine`
**** `neuter`
**** `common`

`number`::: the number of the
designation. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.11.2]
Multiple values are allowed, comma-delimited. Supported values are:

**** `singular`
**** `dual`
**** `plural`

`isPreposition`::: the designation is a preposition; value is boolean (`true` or `false`)

`isParticiple`::: the designation is a participle; value is boolean (`true` or `false`)

`isAdjective`::: the designation is an adjective; value is boolean (`true` or `false`)

`isVerb`::: the designation is a verb; value is boolean (`true` or `false`)

`isAdverb`::: the designation is an adverb; value is boolean (`true` or `false`)

`isNoun`::: the designation is a noun; value is boolean (`true` or `false`)

`grammar-value`::: other miscellaneous grammatical information

NOTE: The "empty designation" is explicitly supported by ISO 10241-1.

===== Non-verbal designations / representations

A figure or formula can be used instead of a verbal expression, provided it
immediately follows a blank designation, before any metadata definition list.

----
====

NOTE: Multiple non-verbal designations are supported by ISO 10241-1.

==== Relations

===== General

In Metanorma, a concept relation is made between the current concept and a
target concept, expected to be defined elsewhere.

That means concept relations are references to target concepts. Accordingly,
concept relations are specified in a syntax similar to that for concept
cross-references
(<<citeterms>>) [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.11.0].

NOTE: Concept relations are NOT supported in Metanorma for ISO, or flavours
derived from that (incl. IEC, BSI).
However, admitted and deprecated designations are supported in Metanorma for ISO.

Target concepts from various sources can be referenced, as described below.

[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
== Terms and definitions

=== mammoth

extinct woolly pachyderm

=== elephant

animal with a trunk and tusks

related:supersedes[mammoth]

related:narrower[<<linnaean:mammalia>>, mammal]

related:contrast[<<mus_musculus>>, mouse]
----
====


===== Concept defined in same document

If the target concept is defined in the same document

[source,adoc]
----
related:RELATION[term]
----

Where:

* `RELATION` is the type of concept relation (<<concept-relation-types>>)
* `term` is the designation of the target concept

NOTE: This is equivalent to a cross-reference to `term:[term]`.


===== Concept defined in external document

If the target concept is defined in an external document (or the same document).

[source,adoc]
----
related:RELATION[<<id>>, term]
----

Where:

* `id` is a bibliographic reference anchor for an external document, or an
anchor within the current document
* `RELATION` is the type of concept relation (<<concept-relation-types>>)
* `term` is the designation of the target concept


===== Concept defined in termbase

If the target concept is defined in a termbase.

[source,adoc]
----
related:RELATION[<<termbase:id>>, term]
----

Where:

* `termbase` is the termbase reference anchor
* `id` is the identifier of the target concept within the specified termbase
* `RELATION` is the type of concept relation (<<concept-relation-types>>)
* `term` is the designation of the target concept


[[concept-relation-types]]
===== Relation types

The following concept relations can be specified

`deprecates`:: the current concept deprecates the nominated concept.
+
NOTE: `related:deprecates[]` is equivalent to `deprecated:[]`.

`supersedes`:: the current concept supersedes the nominated concept.

`narrower`:: the current concept is narrower than the nominated concept.
+
NOTE: This is similar to the `skos:narrower` property in SKOS.

`broader`:: the current concept is broader than the nominated concept.
+
NOTE: This is similar to the `skos:broader` property in SKOS.

`equivalent`:: the current concept is equivalent to the nominated concept.
+
NOTE: `related:equivalent[]` is equivalent to `admitted:[]`.

`compare`:: in order to better understand the current concept, compare it with
the nominated concept.

`contrast`:: in order to better understand the current concept, contrast it with
the nominated concept.

`see`:: in order to better understand the current concept, refer to the
nominated concept.

[NOTE]
--
Concept relations only provide cross-references to concepts defined elsewhere;
admitted and deprecated designations can also provide metadata about the
designations, such as usage notes or grammatical information.

If the admitted and deprecated designations are not defined elsewhere in
the document, use the `admitted:[]` and `deprecated:[]` macros.
--


==== Definitions

===== Multiple definitions

A term may have multiple definitions, where each definition could have its own
source.

Metanorma allows the encoding of this more complex structure through embedding
each distinct definition within an open block, with a `[.definition]` role
attribute [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.6].
Different definitions can be differentiated with different `type`
attributes [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.5.3]

[example]

Multiple definitions are rendered by default in Metanorma as an ordered list of
definitions:

====


===== Non-verbal representation of definitions

A non-verbal representation is identified as a definition instance that consists
of only tables, formulas, and/or figures.

NOTE: A definition that includes tables, formulas, and/or figures as a single
definition is still considered a verbal definition.

The non-verbal representation can be given instead of or after a verbal
definition [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.11.0].

Verbal definitions and non-verbal representations can be given term sources
separately:

=====


==== Sourcing individual concepts

===== General

By default, term sources are considered authoritative, and are of either
`identical` or `modified` status, depending on whether modification text is
provided after a citation.


===== Modifying sourced concepts

A trailing comma after the source reference can indicate that the
term or definition was "`modified`", but with no further detail:

[example]
.Indicating a modified definition without further qualification
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
[.source]
<<ISO7301,section 3.2>>,
--

renders as

.Example of a single source tagged as "`modified`".
image::/assets/author/topics/document-format/section-terms/fig-term-single-source.png[Example of a single source tagged as modified]
====


===== Multiple sources

A term and definition can be sourced from multiple sources (in accordance with
ISO 10241-1). In this case each source should be entered in a separate
`[.source]` paragraph.

[example]
.A term and definition originating from multiple sources
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
[.source]
<<ISO7301,section 3.2>>,

[.source]
<<ISO7302,section 3.10>>
--

The first source will indicate it is "modified" since there is a trailing comma
but no description of modification.
====

NOTE: The mechanism for indicating source is identical for table sources
and figure sources.


===== Sourcing concepts from termbases

The requirement that the source of a term be given in a citation also applies
when the source is a termbase, such as the
http://www.electropedia.org[International Electrotechnical Vocabulary (IEV)].

As with other information source types, the termbase must be first defined
in a references section.

The IEV is handled specially in Metanorma due to its frequency of use and
usage of a specific citation practice as advised by the IEC.

Metanorma requires all IEV references to be to a single reference, named "IEV".

In order to source an IEV term, you would need to:

. Add the "IEV" entry to your reference section using an anchor of your choice;
+
[example]
====
This example adds the "IEV" termbase with a chosen anchor `ievtermbank`.

[source,adoc]
----
* [[[ievtermbank,IEV]]], _IEV: Electropedia_
----
====

. Add the `[.source]` block at the end of the terminology entry.
+
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
[.source]
<<ievtermbank,clause="103-01-02">>
--
====

Note that the clause  should be in quotes, to indicate it is a single cross-reference;
a reference like `<<ievtermbank,clause=103-104>>` would be interpreted as the clause
range 103 through 104. However, Metanorma will treat a reference with two hyphens
as a single cross-reference [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.8.2].

Formally, in accordance with IEC/TC 1 advised practice, IEV references should be
cited as `IEC 60050-nnn:yyyy`, where `n` is the top-level clause, and `yyyy` is
the year when that particular specification was published.

Metanorma automatically converts citations of IEV to citations of the
appropriate IEC 60050 standards according to the correct practice. The "IEV"
entry will be replaced by the appropriate IEC 60050 series references in all
outputs, including the canonical XML.

[example]
====
The following source:

[source,adoc]
----
<<ievtermbank,clause="113-01-07">>
----

will be rendered as:

____
IEC 60050-113:2011, 113-01-07
____
====

NOTE: Do not insert instances of IEC 60050 references for IEV citations; they
will be duplicated by the automatically generated references.

If a terminology entry is sourced from the IEV, Metanorma automatically performs
validation of the sourced entry to detect any modifications.
For IEV entries to be validated, the IEV reference must be given as a `clause`,
and in quotes (otherwise the locality syntax would be interpreted as a range).

[example]
A terminology entry that sources IEV 103-01-02 would use something like
`\<<ievtermbank,clause="103-01-02">>`.

A complete example is given below.

[example]
.Definition of "functional" sourced from the IEV
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
== Terms and definitions

=== functional

function for which the argument is a function and the value a number

NOTE: An example of a functional of the function stem:[f(t)] is
stem:[int_(t_2)^(t_1) bb(d) t]

[.source]
<<ievtermbank,clause="103-01-02">>

...

[bibliography]
== Bibliography

* [[[ievtermbank,IEV]]], _IEV: Electropedia_
--
====

You may wish to go against IEC practice, and cite IEC 60050 as an entire document,
instead of converting references to individual parts of IEC 60050.
In that case, you need to use `IEC 60050 (all parts)` instead of `IEV` in your
bibliography. So a reference to

[source,asciidoc]
----
[.source]
<<ievtermbank,clause="103-01-02">>

...

[bibliography]
== Bibliography

* [[[ievtermbank,IEC 60050 (all parts)]]], _IEV: Electropedia_
----

will have the bibliographic entry reference IEC 60050, instead of resolving that entry to
IEC 60050-103.


===== Citing terminological entries with numeric identifiers

In ISO and IEC, terminological entries are technically identified by
"identifiers", not "clauses", even though they may be similar in format.

In some cases,
like link:https://www.iso.org/obp/ui/#iso:std:iso-iec:2382:ed-1:v1:en[ISO/IEC 2382],
terminological clauses are numbered as plain numbers
without character separators (dashes or periods).

However, when the location is cited as a number, Metanorma will consider
the location a top-level clause, which will be represented in the
ISO style "`Clause X`", instead of the desired "`X`".

[example]
.Indicating a modified definition with qualification
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
[.source]
<<ISO2382,clause 2121372>>, Notes to entry and accepted term
"`computer program`" have been omitted.
--
====

In this case, we will have to apply additional markup to indicate
the number is not a top-level clause using the `droploc%` flag.

[example]
.Dropping the "clause" keyword for non-clause
====
[source,asciidoc]
--
[.source]
<<ISO2382,droploc%clause 2121372>>, Notes to entry and accepted term
"`computer program`" have been omitted.
--
====

`droploc%` serves as an indication for Metanorma not to prepend
the number with the location type of "`Clause`".



===== Complex source attributes

Concept sources can be further qualified other than the simple `identical` or
`modified` statuses by adding explicit `status` and `type`
attributes [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.11.0].

The following attributes are supported for a concept source entry.

`status`::
`identical`::: The managed term in the present context is identical to the term as found in the bibliographic source.

`modified`::: The managed term in the present context has been modified from the term as found in the bibliographic source.

`restyled`::: The managed term in the present context has been restyled from the term as found in the bibliographic source.

`context-added`::: The managed term in the present context has had context added to it, relative to the term as found in the bibliographic source.

`generalisation`::: The managed term in the present context is a generalisation of the term as found in the bibliographic source.

`specialisation`::: The managed term in the present context is a specialisation of the term as found in the bibliographic source.

`unspecified`::: The managed term in the present context is in an unspecified relation to the term as found in the bibliographic source.

`type`::

`authoritative`::: The managed term is authoritative in the present context.

`lineage`::: The managed term constitutes lineage in the present context.

<<ISO2382,clause 2121372>>
----
=====

Term sources may apply designations instead of the entire term. This is done by
placing the term source after the designation, and any metadata definition list
describing the designation.

Term sources applying to the entire term are placed at the end of the term
clause.

==== Rich-text within term commands

The commands `+alt:[...]+`, `+deprecated:[...]+` and `+domain:[...]+`
can contain their own markup.

[example]
.Encoding markup within term commands
====

deprecated:[[smallcap]#cargo# rice]
domain:[rice]

term:[rice] from which the husk only has been removed
--
====

==== Stem expressions

AsciiDoc permits macros to be nested inside other macros.

Therefore the following markup shows that stem expressions can be used
as both admitted terms and preferred terms.

[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]

=== stem:[t_90]
alt:[stem:[t_A]]

[[citeterms]]
=== Referencing concepts through mentions

==== General

Instances of concepts (terms, symbols or abbreviations) used in the document
can be linked to indicate the semantic meaning of the
concept. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.14].

Semantically linking a concept instance is performed in through an action called
a "`concept mention`".

Concept mentions are very useful in showing the reader of the standard what
a particular term means.

Concept mentions have different effects on rendering depending where they are
used:

* when used in the "`terms and definitions`" clauses, a concept mention is
  rendered differently in certain flavors (such as ISO and IEC) in order to
  display location of where those concepts are defined.

* when used in the content body, rendering of concept mentions are generally not
  impacted.

Concept mentions are converted into a distinct `<concept>` element in Metanorma
Semantic XML, which includes a cross-reference to the concept definition, the
canonical form of the term designation, and the text to be displayed for the
term in that instance.


==== Full syntax for concept mentions

NOTE: This section is intended for advanced usage only. Please refer to the
other sections for simple syntaxes for concept mentions.

The full syntax for a concept mention is:

[source,adoc]
----
{{<<identifier>>,term,display-text,cross-reference-text,options="..."}}
----

In this syntax, only the `term` argument is mandatory.

* `identifier`: an identifier for the concept being cited (optional).

* `term`: the concept designation being cited (mandatory).
+
If a domain is used to disambiguate between two terms with the same designation, then
the domain must be prefixed to the term
in angle brackets [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.4.9];
e.g. {{<rice> whole rice}}. The domain may be dropped if the designation is unambiguous within the document.
+
The term must match the source term title for case, because case can be used to
differentiate terms (e.g. _international standard_ and
_International Standard_) [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.0.7].
+
[example]
====
EXAMPLE. From ISO/IEC SMART terminology, where an identical but capitalized
term refers to the identical term in lowercase.

[source,adoc]
----
==== international standard

{{standard}} that is adopted by an international standardizing/standards
organization and made available to the public

[.source]
<<ISO-IEC_Guide_2,clause="3.2.1.1">>

==== International Standard

{{international standard}} where the international standards organization is ISO
or IEC

[.source]
<<ISO-IEC_DIR_2,clause="3.1.4">>
----
====

* `display-text`: text to be displayed, if it is distinct from the cited term
(optional).

** If this argument is not provided, the canonical form and the display
text are assumed to be identical.

* `cross-reference-text`: text to display for the cross-reference to the concept
definition (optional).

** If this argument is not provided, the default rendering of the
cross-reference for the current Metanorma flavour is provided.

* `options`: options that determine how the concept is to be displayed (may be
flavour-specific).

NOTE: The `{{<<identifier>>,term,display-text,cross-reference,options=".."}}`
markup closely mirrors the markup syntax of cross-references in Metanorma
AsciiDoc (`\<<anchor,%option,text>>`).

NOTE: The syntax for citing terms has been changed for v1.10.0.
This section describes the current syntax
[added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.0].


The full syntax enables multiple simple patterns that can be used for concept
mentions.

[example]
.Referencing concepts with supported variant syntaxes
====
[source,adoc]
----
{{term}}                // or synonym: term:[term]
// Used if the concept is defined in the current document.

{{term,display-text}}   // or synonym: term:[term,display-text]
// Used if the concept is defined in the current document, and the desired
// display text differs from the concept term.

{{term,display-text,cross-reference}}
{{term,display-text,cross-reference,options="..."}}

{{<<identifier>>,term}}
{{<<identifier>>,term,display-text}}
{{<<identifier>>,term,display-text,cross-reference-text}}
{{<<identifier>>,term,display-text,cross-reference-text,options="..."}}
----
====


If the Metanorma flavor being used differentiates "concept mentions" and
"concept cross-references" in its rendering, the concept mention
`{{term,display-text}}` will display as:

____
_display-text_ (http://example.com[Clause 3.1.1])
____

where Clause 3.1.1 is the location where the concept `term` is defined.

The concept mention
`{{<<identifier>>,term,display-text,cross-reference-text}}` will display as:

____
_display-text_ (http://example.com[cross-reference-text])
____

where _cross-reference-text_ hyperlinks to the concept _term_, as identified by
its anchor `identifier`.


==== Concepts defined within current document

===== Reference by term

Concept mentions are encoded by having a designation wrapped with doubled curly
braces (`{{...}}`).

[source,adoc]
----
{{concept}}
----

Where,

* the `concept` is a term specified in the document or any designation of that
term.

An alternative syntax for a concept mention uses the command `term:[...]`.

[source,adoc]
----
term:[concept]
----

Rendering of a concept mention differs according to flavour. Typically, the
concept mention contains the term text, and a cross-reference to its definition.
Hyperlinking is done on the cross-reference.

[example]
.Example of concept mention rendering (modified from OGC 20-010)
====
This source:

[source,adoc]
----
=== conceptual model
model that defines concepts of a universe of discourse

=== conceptual schema
formal description of a {{conceptual model}}
----

Renders by default as:

____
formal description of a _conceptual model_ [term defined in Clause 3.6]
____
====



[example]
.Example of concept mention rendering (ISO/IEC Directives Part 2 (2020), 16.5.10)
====
In Metanorma for ISO, concept mentions render according to ISO DIR 2, Clause 16.
The rendering contains the term text, and a cross-reference to its definition,
where a hyperlink is added on the cross-reference.

----

_terminological data_ (3.1) related to one _concept_ (3.2)
____
====


A concept mention can refer to any of the preferred or admitted
designations defined in the current
document [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.0.5].

[example]
.Referencing concepts with preferred or alternate designations
====

preferred:[another preferred designation]
alt:[alternate designation]

...

=== another designation
...

terms can be referenced using the {{first preferred designation}},
any of the other {{other preferred designation}} or {{alternate designation}}
----
====


Sometimes a variant of the referenced term, such as its plural form is used in a
concept mention. That means that the display text needs to be differentiated
from the referenced term.

This can be done by adding the display text after the mentioned concept
separated by a comma.

[source,adoc]
----
{{concept,display-text}}
----

[source,adoc]
----
term:[concept,display-text]
----


.Example of concept mention with display text (ISO 8601:2019, 3.1.1.5)
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
===== instant
...
===== time axis
...
===== time scale
system of ordered marks which can be attributed to {{instant, instants}}
on the {{time axis}}, one instant being chosen as the origin
----

In the rendering, the display text is used instead of the referenced term:

.Rendering of ISO 8601:2019, 3.1.1.5
____
system of ordered marks which can be attributed to _instants_ (3.7) on
the _time axis_ (3.9), one instant being chosen as the origin
____
====


If a specific version of the cross-reference text is required, the following
syntax is to be used.

[source,adoc]
----
{{term,display-text,cross-reference-text}}
----

Authors will want to override the automatically-generated
cross-reference text with their own text, as is already possible for
cross-references within Metanorma.

This requires an expanded version of the expression:

[source,adoc]
----
===== instant
...

===== time axis
...

===== time scale
system of ordered marks which can be attributed to {{instant, instants}} on the
{{time axis,time axis,see the preceding discussion}}, one instant being chosen
as the origin
----

Renders into:

.Rendering of ISO 8601:2019, 3.1.1.5 with custom text
____
system of ordered marks which can be attributed to _instants_ (3.7) on the
_time axis_ (see the preceding discussion), one instant being chosen as the
origin
____


===== Reference by symbol or abbreviated term

Symbols and abbreviated terms defined in the document can also be cited as
concepts [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.1].

The `{{...}}` syntax can also be used for referencing symbols or abbreviated
terms.

When using the `{{...}}` syntax, precedence of reference matching starts with
terms, then symbols, then abbreviated terms.

The `symbol:[]` command can also be used to refer to a symbol or an abbreviated
term, which directly targets a symbol defined in a definition list within the
"`Symbols and abbreviated terms`" section.

NOTE: If there is a particular symbol to be referenced that conflicts with a
term designation, the `symbol:[]` command should be used in that instance.
However, do note that such situation already introduces a conceptual conflict
within the document since a designation is defined more than once.

Concept mentions of symbols and abbreviated terms generally do not get rendered,
they are not italicised, referenced, or hyperlinked by default.
In order to have them rendered, the overriding syntax for supplying
cross-reference text can be used.

[example]
.Concept mentions of symbols in content body do not get rendered
====
The following source:

[source,adoc]
----
== Symbols and abbreviated terms
ISO:: International Standards Organization // automatically assigned the anchor `symbol-ISO`
[[xyz]]IEC:: International Electrotechnical Commission // assigned the anchor `xyz`

== Discussion
The vocabulary is authorised by {{ISO}} and {{IEC,the IEC}}.

// equivalent to the sentence above
The vocabulary is authorised by symbol:[ISO] and symbol:[IEC,the IEC].
----

Renders as:
____
The vocabulary is authorised by ISO and IEC.
____
====


===== Reference by anchor

In certain cases it is more appropriate to reference a concept (defined
in the current document) by anchor, instead of by term, e.g.:

* the defined term is not plain text, e.g., a math formula in MathML;
* the defined term is too long in length.

To reference a concept by anchor, the anchor of the concept should be provided,
and optionally the text to be displayed. The anchor must be given in angle
brackets, like a normal cross-reference in Metanorma AsciiDoc.

The following elements are needed to make this inference:

* anchor of the concept;
* (optional) text to be displayed.

When a concept has a designation that is not in plain text (such as MathML), a
manual anchor can be created for it in order to reference it as a shorthand.

[source,adoc]
----
{{<<identifier>>}}
----

If the display text differs from the cited concept, it can be referred
through an anchor.

[source,adoc]
----
{{<<identifier>>,display-text}}
----

If the display text differs from the mentioned cited concept, referred
through an anchor, a canonical name can be provided for the cited concept.

[source,adoc]
----
{{<<identifier>>,canonical-term,display-text}}
----

[example]
.Example of referencing concepts by anchors
====

Allusions to {{<<immatk>>,unripe kernels,immature kernel}} are plentiful in
the literature.
----
====


==== Concepts from external resources

To refer to concepts from an external resources requires a corresponding
bibliographic anchor for that resource. The identifier for the concept
is then given in the same fashion as any citation of an external resource.

The following elements are needed to make this inference:

* bibliographic anchor of the external resource, optionally including the
  locality of the term definition in that resource;
* concept term name;
* (optional) text to be displayed;
* (optional) cross-reference text to be displayed.

A concept from an external resource is referenced through a bibliographic anchor
to that external resource, and by providing the term designation used in the
external resource.

[source,adoc]
----
{{<<bibliographic-anchor>>,term}}
----

Display text can be specified if the cited concept term differs from the desired
text to be shown.

[source,adoc]
----
{{<<bibliographic-anchor>>,term,display-text}}
----

The cross-reference text for the external document can also be overridden.

----
{{<<bibliographic-anchor>>,term,display-text,cross-reference-text}}
----

In Metanorma, this will be displayed by default as:

____
The source of the _immature kernel_ [term defined in ISO 17301] has not yet been
identified. Allusions to _unripe kernels_ [term defined in ISO 17301] are
plentiful in the literature.
____

NOTE: Metanorma Semantic XML preserves the information that the latter term is
cited as _unripe kernels_, but is defined as _immature kernel_. However by
default, only the display text is rendered.
====

To supplement the concept reference with a locality, the `bibliographic-anchor`
element can be supplemented by a comma-delimited list of
link:/author/topics/inline_markup/citations/#localities[localities and locality values],
as is normal for a reference to a locality in an external document.

==== Concepts from external termbase

To refer to a concept from an external termbase, the termbase
identifier and the concept identifier within that termbase are needed.

The following elements are needed to make this inference:

* termbase identifier;
* concept identifier within that termbase;
* (optional) text to be displayed for the term;
* (optional) text to be displayed for the termbase reference.

NOTE: The presence of a colon identifies the first argument in a term citation
as identifying an external termbase term, since colons are not permitted in
cross-references or bibliographic anchors.

NOTE: Termbase identifiers are treated as special anchors, they do not need
to be defined using a bibliographic reference anchor.

The syntax to reference a termbase for a concept mention is:

[source,adoc]
----
{{termbase-id:concept-id,term}}
----

Display text can be specified if the cited concept term differs from the desired
text to be shown.

[source,adoc]
----
{{termbase-id:concept-id,term,display-text}}
----

The cross-reference text for the external document can also be overridden.

[source,adoc]
----
{{termbase-id:concept-id,term,display-text,cross-reference-text}}
----

NOTE: The termbase does not require a corresponding reference in the
bibliography.

Currently, only the IEC Electropedia (IEV) is supported, where the
reference syntax is `<<IEV:{IEV concept ID}>>`.

[source,adoc]
----
// Not necessary to define the IEV bibliographic anchor.
{{<<IEV:IEV-concept-ID>>,term}}

// If the display text differs from the cited concept term.
{{<<IEV:IEV-concept-ID>>,text,display-term}}

// If the IEV citation text differs from the flavour default.
{{<<IEV:IEV-concept-ID>>,text,display-term,cross-reference-text}}

==== Rendering options

The following rendering options, introduced with `options="..."`, are defined
for concept mentions.

`ital`:: italicise the rendered term [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.1]
`noital`:: do not italicise the rendered term [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.1]

`bold`:: boldface the rendered term [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.3.2]
`nobold`:: do not boldface the rendered term [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.3.2]

`ref`:: provide a reference for the rendered term [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.1]
`noref`:: do not provide a reference for the rendered term [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.1]

`linkmention`:: hyperlink the rendered term to a term definition [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.6]
`nolinkmention`:: do not hyperlink the rendered term to a term definition [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.6]

`linkref`:: hyperlink the reference for the term to a term definition [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.6]
`nolinkref`:: do not hyperlink the reference for the term to a term definition [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.10.6]

If these options are missing, Metanorma applies the defaults for the current
flavour.

The default behaviour in Metanorma is:

* for all terms (italics and cited): `ital,nobold,ref,nolinkmention,linkref`

* for acronyms (no special rendering): `noital,nobold,noref,nolinkmention,nolinkref`

NOTE: In Metanorma for IEEE, the default behaviour is
`noital,nobold,noref,nolinkmention,nolinkref` for all terms (i.e. no special rendering
for a term cited within a term definition.)


In ISO, the default behaviour for terms is refined:

* for terms outside the "`Terms and definitions`" section:
  `noital,nobold,noref,nolinkmention,nolinkref` (no special rendering);

* for the first mention of a term within the "`Terms and definitions`"
  section: `ital,nobold,ref,nolinkmention,linkref` (italics, cited, hyperlinked);

* for all subsequent mentions within the "`Terms and definitions`" section:
  `ital,nobold,noref,nolinkmention,linkref` (italics, hyperlinked, no citation).

In BSI, the default behaviour for terms is: `noital,bold,ref,nolinkmention,linkref`

==== Implementation note on term anchors

Concept mentions in Metanorma relies on automatically created anchor references
for every term defined.

Metanorma automatically creates anchor references for every concept from the
document, which is used when referencing by term.

Specifically, anchors are generated from the terms themselves according to these rules:

* the anchor starts with the type of the concept, such as `term-` for
terminology entries and `symbol-` for symbols and abbreviated terms;

* the designation is lowercased;

* non-ASCII characters are stripped;

* whitespaces are replaced by `-`.

[example]
.Example of automatically generated anchors in Metanorma
====
In the following text,

[source,adoc]
----
== Terms and definitions
=== Foo
bar

=== Lor
special kind of {{foo}}
----

the anchors `\[[term-foo]]` and `\[[term-lor]]` are automatically created and
assigned to the terms 'foo` and `lor`.
====

This means if you wanted to refer to a particular term from body text, you could
either:

* directly refer to the term: e.g., `see definition of {{foo}}`
* refer to the anchor of the term: e.g., `the topic is further explained in \<<term-foo>>`

In case you have created manual anchors that conflict with `[[term-{X}]]`, the
term reference mechanism is smart enough to rename the generated anchor as
`[[term-{X}-{n}]]`, where `n` is a number from 1, and so forth.

Therefore this will still work as expected:

[source,adoc]
----
== Terms and definitions
=== Foo
bar

=== Lor
special kind of {{foo}}

[[term-foo]]
== My section
