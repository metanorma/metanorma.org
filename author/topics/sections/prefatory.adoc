== Prefatory clauses

Prefatory sections are introductory sections that appear before the actual
content is shown, for example, the "`Foreword`" section.


=== General

By default the single prefatory clause is identified with the pre-defined
section titles:

* `Foreword`


=== Foreword

A foreword is a full Metanorma AsciiDoc section, with the
title "`Foreword`"; this can be overruled in different flavours.
 [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.19]
A foreword may contain subclauses.

== Foreword
The Calendaring and Scheduling Consortium ("`CalConnect`") is a global non-profit
organization with the aim to facilitate interoperability of technologies across
user-centric systems and applications...

=== Foreword subclause

[NOTE]
====
Metanorma AsciiDoc also supports a simple foreword clause syntax, using the
AsciiDoc preamble (any text between the document header and the first section
header). This syntax is restrictive (it requires there to be no preceding
clauses and no subclauses), and is now deprecated.

The example below specifies the `.Foreword` title to the foreword in the source.
(Strictly speaking, this is the caption of the first paragraph in the foreword,
but it is used as the foreword header since the Foreword must precede any
AsciiDoc section headers.)

Metanorma will supply the "`Foreword`" title if no such title is given.

=== Arbitrary prefatory clauses

Arbitrary prefatory clauses are allowed in some flavors, and are disallowed
but "`accepted`" for encoding in certain flavors for backwards compatibility reasons.

NOTE: Most flavors specify requirements on preface sections. Most flavors specify
mandatory and optional preface sections, while some completely disallow arbitrary
preface sections.

[example]
In ISO only the "`Foreword`" is allowed -- arbitrarily named
preface sections are prohibited, in accordance with ISO Directives Part 2.


Any section detected as the "`Foreword`", or labelled as "`Introduction`",
"`Acknowledgements`" [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.19], 
"`Executive summary`" [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v3.0.7], or
"`Abstract`", will be inserted into the document preface.

Any other first-level clauses tagged with the role attribute
`[.preface]` are also moved into the document preface
 [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.19].

If these prefatory sections are provided, they will be displayed in the following default ordering:

* "`Abstract`"
* "`Foreword`"
* "`Introduction`"
* Preface clauses. Any prefatory clauses that don't fit the other specially "`named`" sections will be placed here.
* "`Acknowledgments`"
* "`Executive summary`"
