= LutaML for UML plugin

== Purpose

Many standards organizations, such as OGC, ISO and IEC, rely on
https://www.omg.org/spec/UML/[UML] to describe and standardize
conceptual or implementation models.

Standards authors who wish to describe a UML model in a standard document
may take advantage of the Metanorma "`model-based authoring`" approach, where
the author can programmatically generate content by having Metanorma navigate
through the actual UML model.

The LutaML for UML plugin supports navigating through UML models stored in
https://www.omg.org/spec/XMI/[XMI] files (version 2.4+).

NOTE: Currently, only XMI files exported via Enterprise Architect (versions
15.0+) from https://sparxsystems.com[SparxSystems] are officially supported.
In particular, Enterprise Architect supports the export of a "`Canonical UML
XMI`" model file, where the LutaML for UML plugin takes as input.


== Basic UML concepts

An UML XMI model file can contain a combination of the following objects:

* Package
* Class / Enumerations / Classifiers
* Attributes
* Associations
* Instances


== Describing UML packages

=== General

A common use case in standards authoring is to iterate through a UML package
and have the document perform the following:

* display diagrams of the package
* describe classes and associations in the package
** for each class, describe its attributes
* describe enumerations in the package

The following syntax allows for navigating within one or more UML packages
in an XMI model file and generating text from them.

=== lutaml_uml_datamodel_description

==== Syntax

The `lutaml_uml_datamodel_description` command renders UML packages and its
dependent objects from a XMI model file.

[source,adoc]
----
[lutaml_uml_datamodel_description, path/to/file.xmi, path/to/config.yml]
--
{block}
--
----

The `lutaml_uml_datamodel_description` command takes two arguments and a block:

* `path/to/file.xmi`: location of the XMI file.
* `path/to/config.yml`: (optional) configuration that specifies what packages
  and classes to iterate through.
* `{block}`: (optional) provides the ability to insert specified content
  before or after designated packages.

==== Inserting text via the supplied block

Within the supplied block to the command, the following roles are available:

`[.before]`::
macro to add additional text before the rendered output. There
are two variants.

`[.before]`:::
When provided without the `package` attribute, specifies
text to be inserted before the description of the first package.
+
NOTE: This role is only to be entered once per block, additional occurrences of
the role will overwrite the previous content.

`[.before, package="{package-name}"]`:::
When provided with the `package`
attribute to specify locality of the block, specifies text to be inserted
before the description of the chosen package.
+
NOTE: This role is only to be entered once per package, additional occurrences
of the role will overwrite the previous content.

`[.after]`::
macro to add additional text after the rendered output. There
are two variants.

`[.after]`:::
When provided without the `package` attribute, specifies
text to be inserted after the description of the last package.
+
NOTE: This role is only to be entered once per block, additional occurrences of
the role will overwrite the previous content.

`[.after, package="{package-name}"]`:::
When provided with the `package`
attribute to specify locality of the block, specifies text to be inserted
after the description of the chosen package.
+
NOTE: This role is only to be entered once per package, additional occurrences
of the role will overwrite the previous content.

==== Selecting and ordering packages

The `lutaml_uml_datamodel_description` command supports selection and ordering
of packages from the XMI file by providing a YAML configuration file.

The YAML configuration file is optional to the command.

The format of the configuration file is as follows:

[source,yaml]
-----
---
packages:
  # includes these packages
  - "Package *"
  - two*
  - three
  # skips these packages
  - skip: four
-----

Where:

* `packages`: required, root element with an array of strings or objects.

** string: treated as an regular expression pattern to be matched against
  package names for inclusion.

** object: only the `skip` key is supported in an object, where the packages
  with names matching the value of the `skip` key are excluded.

* the order of the array determines the order of packages rendered in text.


In this example,

* `pass:["Package *"]`: performs pattern matching, equal to the following regular
  expression: `pass:[/^Package .*$/]`

* `skip: four`: excludes packages with a name that matches this criteria.

* The command will read the supplied YAML file and arrange packages according
  to the order supplied in the config file.


==== Illustration

For example, given an XMI file named `example.xmi` which contains 2 UML
packages, 'Package-One' and 'Package-Two', the following Metanorma AsciiDoc
syntax can be used.

[source,adoc]
----
[lutaml_uml_datamodel_description, path/to/example.xmi]
--
[.before]
---
This text will be inserted before the description of all packages.
---

[.before, package="Package-One"]
---
This text will be inserted before the description of the package Package-One.
---

[.after, package="Package-One"]
---
This text will be inserted after the description of the package Package-One.
---

[.after, package="Package-Two"]
---
This text will be inserted after the description of the package Package-Two.
---

[.after]
---
This text will be inserted after the description of all packages.
---
--
----


Will translate into this output:

[source,adoc]
----
This text will be inserted before the description of all packages.

This text will be inserted before the description of the package Package-One.
