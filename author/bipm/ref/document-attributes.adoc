[NOTE]
====
The document attributes listed below are unique to Metanorma's processing of BIPM documents.

For _common document attributes_, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes[Document attributes reference] in general Metanorma author's documentation. That page describes attributes that apply to all Metanorma flavors, not just BIPM.

For an _introduction to Metanorma AsciiDoc document attributes_ and how Metanorma uses them, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[the corresponding topic].
