//General info about metadata
//include::/author/topics/metadata.adoc[tag=metadata-intro]

== General

The header contains information about the document (metadata). You specify these
metadata by using predefined document attributes, that look like this:

[source,adoc]
----
:document-attribute: some-value
----

Most of the attributes take a value, while others are simple flags without a
value, like:

[source,adoc]
----
:novalid:
----

Some of the metadata will be visible in your document, such as `:title:`, while
others are not visible but still affect how your document is generated.


The order of attributes does not matter to Metanorma.

You can specify metadata about:

* Authors: issuing organization, authors, and their location

* Document info: language, document stages (draft, published, etc.) copyright holder, etc.

* Dates: draft dates, revision dates, publishing date, copyright year, etc.

* Identifiers: document numbers, ISBNs, URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers)

NOTE: Other metadata influence how the document is generated and should only be
used by advanced users. Please refer to the OGC document attributes.

At a minimum, you will need to specify:

* Title
* Metanorma document class as `ogc`
* Document number
* Document type, and optionally subtype
* Document stage
* Committee
* Author or editor

NOTE: Please refer to reference documentation to see the full list of
link:/author/ogc/ref/document-attributes/[OGC-specific document attributes].

NOTE: In this section we use the document header from
https://github.com/metanorma/mn-samples-ogc/blob/c19e2fe8354ea331c25b28b32294394bfdf38161/sources/17-069r3/document.adoc[OGC 17-069r3] to explain.

// OGC example
== Document-specific attributes and basic operations

These are the basic document attributes for OGC.

.Setting basic document attributes for OGC
[example]
====
----
= API - Features - Part 1: Core <1>
:docnumber: 17-069r3 <2>
:external-id: http://www.opengis.net/doc/IS/ogcapi-features-1/1.0 <3>
----
<1> OGC document title.
<2> OGC document number.
<3> OGC External ID for this deliverable.
====

These are operational concerns that are useful for the author.

* `:mn-document-class:` must be set in order to set the flavor to OGC.

* `:mn-output-extensions:` determines what output to be produced.

.Setting OGC-specific attributes
[example]
====
----
:mn-document-class: ogc <1>
:mn-output-extensions: xml,html,doc,pdf,rxl <2>
:local-cache-only: <3>
----
<1> Metanorma flavor. For OGC, enter `ogc`.
<2> Metanorma output formats. For OGC, supported formats are `xml`, `html`, `pdf`, `doc` and `rxl`.
<3> Metanorma option to store data cache in the current directory.
====


== Document types and subtypes

OGC offers many different types of deliverables that differ in the level of
consensus.

Some types, such as `standard` and `best-practice` have subtypes that must be
set.

The type is to be set via these two attributes:

* `:doctype:` for the document type
* `:docsubtype:` for the document subtype, necessary for certain `:doctypes:`

Document types, set using the `:doctype:` attribute, include:

* `standard`: Standard (a document subtype is necessary) (_default_)
* `draft-standard`: Draft Standard (a document subtype is necessary) [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v2.2.6]
* `abstract-specification-topic`: Abstract Specification
* `best-practice`: Best Practice (a document subtype is necessary)
* `change-request-supporting-document`: Change Request Supporting Document
* `community-practice`: Community Practice
* `community-standard`: Community Standard
* `discussion-paper`: Discussion Paper
* `engineering-report`: Engineering Report
* `other`: Note, Primer, etc.
* `policy`: Policy, Policy -- Name Type Specification
* `reference-model`: Reference Model
* `release-notes`: Release Notes
* `test-suite`: Test Suite
* `user-guide`: User Guide
* `white-paper`: White Paper

Document subtypes, set using the `:docsubtype:` attribute, include:

* For `:doctype:` set to `standard` or `draft-standard`:
** `implementation`: Implementation (_default_)
** `conceptual-model`: Conceptual model
** `conceptual-model-and-encoding`: Conceptual model and encoding
** `conceptual-model-and-implementation`: Conceptual model and implementation
** `encoding`: Encoding
** `extension`: Extension
** `profile`: Profile
** `profile-with-extension`: Profile with extension

* For `:doctype:` set to `best-practice`:
** `general`: General (_default_)
** `encoding`: Encoding
** `extension`: Extension
** `profile`: Profile
** `profile-with-extension`: Profile with extension

.Setting document type and subtype
[example]
====
----
:doctype: standard <1>
:docsubtype: implementation <2>
----
<1> OGC document type.
<2> OGC document subtype. Not all OGC deliverables have subtype.
====

== Document stages and progress dates

OGC deliverables go through various stages of consensus building.

The document stage is set via the `:status:` attribute.

Values accepted by the `:status:` attribute include:

* For an OGC standard, an OGC draft standard, and an abstract specification topic,
it goes through the stages of: `swg-draft`, `oab-review`, `public-rfc`, `tc-vote` and `approve`.

* An OGC community standard goes through the same stages as a normal standard,
except `swg-draft` is replaced with `work-item-draft`.

* All other types only have one `draft` stage and then goes to `approved`.

* OGC deliverables can also be `rescinded` or `retired` but these are not
discussed here.

.Setting document stage and progress dates
[example]
====
----
:edition: 1.0 <1>
:status: approved <2>
:received-date: 2019-07-11 <3>
:issued-date: 2019-09-09 <4>
:published-date: 2019-10-14 <5>
----
<1> OGC document edition. This is optional.
<2> OGC document status.
<3> OGC date of receipt.
<4> OGC date of issuance.
<5> OGC date of publication.
====

== Authorship and other preface information

There are three types of authorship information:

* The working group that created the document, this is set via the `:committee:`
attribute.

* The individual contributors that created the document, this is set via the
`:fullname:` and `:role:` attributes. Additional contributors are set by
suffixing the attribute with a `_{n}` where {n} is a sequential number after 1,
e.g. For `:fullname_2:` use `:role_2:`.

* The submitting organizations (active OGC members) that submitted this document
(i.e. supported the adoption of the document), this is set via the
`:submitting-organizations:` attribute as semicolon-delimited values.

.Usage of authorship information
[example]
====

----
:committee: technical <1>
:fullname: Clemens Portele <2>
:fullname_2: Panagiotis (Peter) A. Vretanos
:fullname_3: Charles Heazel
:role: editor <3>
:role_3: editor
:keywords: OGC API, ISO, ISO/TC 211, geographic information, Geospatial API <4>
:submitting-organizations: CubeWerx Inc.; Heazeltech LLC; Hexagon; ... <5>
----
<1> OGC committee. Typically `technical` for standards.
<2> Name of the individual contributor (author or editor).
<3> Role of author or editor. To set role of a `:fullname_2:` use `:role_2:`. If
the role value is not provided, it is set to `author` by default.
<4> List of OGC keywords, comma-delimited.
<5> List of OGC members submitting this deliverable, semicolon-delimited.
====

== Metadata references

Metadata defined as document attributes can be used to substitute values defined
by putting the attribute in curly braces `{attribute}`. The reference will be
replaced with the value in the rendered output.

.Using a document attribute for variable replacement
[example]
====

[source,adoc]
----
:architecture-dwg: OGC Architecture Domain Working Group

This document was prepared by the {architecture-dwg}.
----

renders as:

____
This document was prepared by the OGC Architecture Domain Working Group.
____
====


== Revision history

Revision history is encoded using
link:/author/topics/metadata/history#detailed-history[detailed change history]
 [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v2.5.0].

Revision history is rendered as the "Revision history" annex always located as
the last annex.

The official structure for document history is as follows:

Date:: represented as `date`, with type `published`, `updated` (modifications to
document), or `issued` (circulated drafts).

Release:: represented as `edition`, or `version/draft`.

Author:: represented as one or more `contributor` objects, following Relaton
YAML. The role of the contributor can be specified optionally, as `role/type`,
to differentiate editors from the default role of `author`.

Paragraph modified:: represented as `amend/location`, with locality specified as
in bibliographic cross-references; note that `whole` is used in Relaton to
specify the entire document (and will be rendered as "all" in the generated
document).

Description:: represented as `amend/description`, can contain inline and block
AsciiDoc markup.

The following is an illustration of semantic document history markup for OGC.
