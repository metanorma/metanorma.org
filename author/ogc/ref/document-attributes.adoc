== Author info

`:committee:`::
*Mandatory.*
Name of relevant committee producing the document. Use one of:
+
--
* `technical`: Technical Committee
* `planning`: Planning Committee
* `strategic-member-advisory`: Strategic Member Advisory Committee
--

`:subcommittee-type:`::
The type of the relevant subcommittee producing the document.

`:subcommittee-number:`::
The number of the relevant subcommittee producing the document.

`:workgroup:`::
*Mandatory.*
Name of relevant working group producing the document.

`:workgroup-type:`::
Type of the relevant workgroup producing the document.

`:workgroup-number:`::
Number of the relevant workgroup producing the document.

`:submitting-organizations:`::
Semicolon-delimited list of the submitting organizations
for this document. The organization names themselves may contain commas.
+
[example]
.Example of setting submitting organizations
====
_University of Calgary, Canada; National Central University, Taiwan_
====

`:role:`::
Role of contributor (`link:/author/ref/document-attributes/#role[:role:]`).
Legal values are `author`, `editor`, and [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ogc/releases/tag/v2.0.2]
`contributor`.

`:editor:`::
Same as `link:/author/ref/document-attributes/#fullname[:fullname:]`
alongside `link:/author/ref/document-attributes/#role[:role:]` specified as `editor`.


== URIs and IDs

`:external-id:`::
External identifier referring to this document. If not supplied, a default value is
generated: `http://www.opengis.net/doc/{abbrevation of doctype}/{abbrev}/{version}`.
(Version is omitted if not provided. If `:abbrev:` and `:doctype:` are not provided,
the default value is not generated.

`:referenceURLID:`::
Identifier embedded into a document type-specific external URL.

`:previous-uri:`::
URI of previous version of the document.

`:docnumber:`::
The document number assigned to the OGC document (without the "`OGC`" prefix).
+
--
NOTE: A new document number is obtained through the
https://portal.ogc.org/?m=public&subtab=instructions&tab=1["`OGC Pending Documents`"]
page at the OGC portal.

The number is of the pattern `YY-NNN{rM}` formulated following the following rules:

* `YY` represents the final two digits of the year this document number was first reserved.

* `NNN` is a three digit number is assigned sequentially for each document in the year.

* `{rM}` is only for revisions:

** The first edition of a document has the document number `YY-NNN`. e.g., `00-027` is OGC document 027 first published in 2000.

** Minor editorial changes and corrigenda do not result in a change to the document number.

** The `YY-NNN` identifier portion is maintained if the document undergoes content changes (revisions).

** A revised document will have its identifier suffixed with `r` followed by the revision number `M`, a sequential number indicating the number of revisions. So `05-020r27` is revision 27 of OGC document 020 first published in 2005. (Revision 27 may appear years later than 2005.)

* A new major version of a document receives a new document number, including likely a new year.

== Legacy information

[[legacy-ogc-whitepaper]]
=== OGC White Paper now renamed as Technical Paper

The OGC Planning Committee at the 121st OGC Member Meeting has approved the
rename of the document type "`White Paper`" to "`Technical Paper`".

All documents issued or published before 2021-12-16 will remain with the
document type "`White Paper`", and documents published on or after that date
will have the document type "`Technical Paper".

The two document types are treated identically, and are rendered differently
depending on the date published or issued.


=== OGC identity design

OGC has launched its current identity together with its new logo and color
scheme on 2021-11-08.

Both current and previous identity designs are supported in Metanorma-OGC.
The differences include:

* OGC logo
* PDF color scheme

Application of the branding design depends solely on the publication date
of an OGC deliverable:

* a deliverable with a publication date on or after 2021-11-08 will use the
  new branding;

* a deliverable dated prior to 2021-11-08 will utilize the previous branding.

==== PDF color scheme

The PDF color scheme can be redefined via these attributes:

`:presentation-metadata-color-text:`::
Color of the document body text.

`:presentation-metadata-color-secondary-shade-1:`::
Color of the text on the cover page, unordered list labels, 'crossing lines' design element, color of the circle for section's number, ToC.

`:presentation-metadata-color-secondary-shade-2:`::
Color of the 'crossing lines' design element on the preface pages.

`:presentation-metadata-color-background-definition-term:`::
Color of the background of definition term.

`:presentation-metadata-color-background-definition-description:`::
Color of the background of definition description.

`:presentation-metadata-color-text-title:`::
Color of the clause, table, figure, list titles.

`:presentation-metadata-color-background-page:`::
Color of the cover page and section pages background.

`:presentation-metadata-color-background-text-label-legacy:`::
Color of the background of the label 'Legacy' and bottom text about 'legacy' document on the cover page.

`:presentation-metadata-color-background-term-preferred-label:`::
Color of the background of the label 'PREFERRED'.

`:presentation-metadata-color-background-term-deprecated-label:`::
Color of the background of the label 'DEPRECATED`.

`:presentation-metadata-color-background-term-admitted-label:`::
Color of the background of the label 'ADMITTED`

`:presentation-metadata-color-background-table-header:`::
Color of the table header background.

`:presentation-metadata-color-background-table-row-even:`::
Color of the 'even' table rows background.

`:presentation-metadata-color-background-table-row-odd:`::
Color of the 'odd' table rows background.


=== Mapping to OGC legacy AsciiDoc

Metanorma-OGC permits legacy OGC AsciiDoc template attributes,
and are treated as synonyms of the corresponding Metanorma attributes:

|===
| OGC Metanorma AsciiDoc                    | OGC legacy AsciiDoc

| `:copyright-year:`                        | `:copyrightYear`
| `:workgroup:`                             | `:workingGroup:`
| `:published-date:`                        | `:publicationDate:`
| `:issued-date:`                           | `:approvalDate:`
| `:received-date:`                         | `:submissionDate:`
| `:docnumber:`                             | `:docReference:`
| `:fullname:`, with `:role:` = `editor`    | `:editor:`
| `:edition:`                               | `:version:`
