= Metanorma NIST document attributes

[[note_general_doc_ref_doc_attrib_nist]]
[NOTE]
====
Document attributes listed below are unique to the processing of IEEE SA documents
in Metanorma.

For _common document attributes_, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[Document attributes reference] in general Metanorma author's documentation. That page describes attributes that apply to all Metanorma flavors, not just IEEE SA.

For an _introduction to Metanorma AsciiDoc document attributes_ and how Metanorma uses them, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[the corresponding topic].
====

== Document information

The general Metanorma document attributes relevant to NIST documents include:

`:edition:`:: The document version; e.g. `2.0`.

`:revdate:`:: The date the document was last updated.

`:copyright-year:`:: The year which will be claimed as when the copyright for
the document was issued.

`:title-main:`:: The main component of the title of the document
(mandatory). If absent, the first line of the AsciiDoc document, which contains the title
introduced with `=`, is used.

`:uri:`:: The URI to which this standard is published.

`:status:`:: Document status/stage. The permitted types are:
+
--
* `draft-internal`
* `draft-wip`
* `draft-prelim`
* `draft-public`
* `draft-approval`
* `final` (default: document is published)
* `final-review`
--

`:substage:`:: Document substage. Indicates active status of draft or publication.
If a draft or publication is inactive, that is reflected in the coverpage. The
permitted types are:
+
--
* `active` (default)
* `retired` (applies only to drafts, when they are abandoned). The `:abandoned-date:` must
be provided, to indicate when the draft was abandoned.
* `withdrawn` (applies to drafts, when when they are superseded by the next draft stage,
and to published documents when they are superseded or no longer valid.
--

`:language:`::
Two-letter code (ISO 639-1) of the language the document is written in. Defaults to `en`.
If multiple languages are used in the document, comma-delimited; e.g. `en,fr`.


The following document attributes are specific to NIST:

`:title-sub:`:: The subtitle of the document.

`:title-main-short:`:: Shortened form of the title of the document. For use in Word header.
If not provided, `:title-main:` is used.

`:title-sub-short:`:: Shortened form of The subtitle of the document. For use in Word header.
If not provided, `:title-sub:` is used.

`:title-document-class:`:: The title of the document class that the document belongs to;
e.g. "Computer Security" for SP 800.

`:keywords:`:: Comma-delimited list of the keywords associated with the document.

`:iteration:`:: The iteration of a stage, in case there have been multiple drafts.
Can be a number, or text (e.g. "initial", "final").

== Document identifier
The general Metanorma document attributes relevant to NIST documents include:

`:docnumber:`:: The internal identifier referring to this document. The identifier is a number;
the prefix, e.g. "NIST SP", is supplied by the `:series:` attribute. The NIST identifier is
docnumber-edition (if edition is present)

`:docidentifier:`:: The document identifier for the document. Normally this should not be supplied,
as the document identifier is composed from the document series, document number, document volume,
and edition/revision (e.g. _NIST SP 800 Revision 1_).

If the `:docidentifier:` value is provided, it will override this composed value.

CSWP publications do not have a distinct `:docidentifier:` or `:docnumber:`: they are identified
by their `:issued-date:`.



The following document attributes are specific to NIST:

`:revision:`:: The document revision; e.g. `1` (Revision 1). Will be stored in Metanorma XML
under the `<edition>` tag, with the prefix `Revision `.

`:version:`:: The document version, when titled as version. Will be stored in Metanorma XML
under the `<edition>` tag, with the prefix `Version `. 
It is also being treated as the `<version><draft>`
version, consistent with the rest of Metanorma [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v3.1.0].

`:volume:`::
The number of the volume of a standard. Is ignored if a precomposed
document identifier (`:docidentifier:`) is supplied.
Is prefixed with "Volume" or "Vol." in display.

`:part:`::
The part number of a standard. Is only used to generate machine readable NIST identifier (nist-mr).

`:section:`::
The section number of a standard. Is only used to generate machine readable NIST identifier (nist-mr).

`:supplement:`::
The supplement number of a standard. Is only used to generate machine readable NIST identifier (nist-mr).
Can be supplied with an empty value to indicate that this is a supplement of a standard.

`:index:`::
The index number of a standard. Is only used to generate machine readable NIST identifier (nist-mr).
Can be supplied with an empty value to indicate that this is an index of a standard.

`:update:`::
The update number of a standard. Is only used to generate machine readable NIST identifier (nist-mr).

`:addendum:`::
The document is an addendum to a document. Used to generate machine readable NIST identifier (nist-mr),
and to style document as addendum.

`:doi:`:: DOI URL for document (distinct from `:uri:`, which is the URL that NIST
publishes the document under.)


== Document series
The following document attributes are specific to NIST:


`:series:`:: The publication series that the document belongs to. Legal values are given
as the keys of the
https://github.com/metanorma/pubid-nist/blob/main/series.yaml[pubid-nist series listing] [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-nist/releases/tag/v2.4.0]. For legacy purposes, `nist-*` is converted  to `NIST *` in all caps; and `nist-cswp`
(Cybersecurity White Papers) is converted to the correct `CSRC White Paper`.
`nist-csts` is also supported as an ad hoc series.

Documents belonging to different series are expected to be rendered differently. As of this
writing, styling has been provided for `nist-cswp` (Cybersecurity White Papers),
`nist-csts` (Cybersecurity Technical Specifications) [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-nist/releases/tag/v1.2.10],
and for `nist-sp` (SP-800).

`:series-title:`:: (Added in v1.2.10)
`:series-mrprefix:`:: (Added in v1.2.10)
`:series-abbrev:`:: (Added in v1.2.10) The formal documents published by NIST belong to a registered
list of series, each with a predefined title and abbreviation. Non-formal documents instead belong
to ad hoc series defined for the purposes of Metanorma, such as `nist-csts`. That particular series
acts as an umbrella for user-defined series of publications; so when it is used, the user needs to provide
a title (e.g. "Automated Cryptographic Validation Protocol") and abbreviation (e.g. ACVP) for the user-defined
series. The user also needs to provide the prefix by which the series will be identified in the machine-readable
NIST identifier, when it is at variance with the abbreviation.
+
--
In this case, CSTS is retained as the primary series of the publication (and all CSTS documents
are rendered the same way), and ACVP is modelled as a secondary series specific to CSTS. However,
the series information rendered for the document involves the user-defined series, not CSTS itself.
--


== Document dates

The general Metanorma document attributes relevant to NIST documents include:

`:issued-date:`:: The date on which the document was authorised to be published.
Referred to within NIST as the "Publication Date". This is the date used on the document
cover page. Only applies to public documents;
drafts instead have a `:circulated-date:` attribute.

`:published-date:`:: The publication date for the document, when it was physically released.
Referred to within NIST as the "Release Date". This date is not used on the document cover
page; `:issued-date:` is used instead. The Release Date is included in NIST bibliographic metadata.

`:obsoleted-date:`::
The date at which a document is considered no longer valid (withdrawn). If a document
is not currently withdrawn (as indicated through `:substage: withdrawn`),
but will be in the future, that is still indicated in the rendering of the document.

`:confirmed-date:`::
The date at which a document has been reviewed according to the NIST ERB 5-year review process,
and has been confirmed to be relevant and valid to date. If this attribute is present,
the date is included in the cover page.

`:updated-date:`::
The date at which a document has been updated without being considered a distinct new publication.
Used to indicate the date of errata releases.

`:circulated-date:`::
The date at which a draft is circulated. Displayed on the cover page of drafts.
MANDATORY FOR DRAFTS.



The following document attributes are specific to NIST:

`:comment-from:`:: The beginning of the period during which comments may be submitted to the NIST
document draft. ISO-8601 date.

`:comment-to:`:: The end of the period during which comments may be submitted to the NIST document
draft. The end of the period may change, and may be left open-ended (omitted). ISO-8601 date.

`:comment-extended:`:: The date on which the during which comments may be submitted to the NIST document
draft was extended.

`:superseded-date:`::
The date at which both this document and the document superseding it  come into effect,
as a transition period before this document is withdrawn. May be identical to `:obsoleted-date:`,
in which case there is no such transition period. Is indicated in withdrawn publication
cover page; if not provided, the value of `:obsoleted-date:` is given.

`:abandoned-date:`::
The date at which work on a document is abandoned. At that date, the document is considered
retired (`substage: retired`). In NIST, only drafts may be retired. If the document
is not currently retired (as indicated through `:substage: retired`),
but will be in the future, that is still indicated in the rendering of the document.



== Document relationships

The general Metanorma document attributes relevant to NIST documents include:

`:merges:`:: This document incorporates the document(s) with the nominated
identifiers (semicolon-delimited).

`:updates:`:: This document is an update of the document(s) with the nominated
identifiers (semicolon-delimited).

The following document attributes are specific to NIST:

`:obsoletes:`::
One or more NIST document that this NIST document standard renders obsolete; implies that the obsoleted
document is withdrawn, and no longer in effect. Comma delimited.
Format is document identifier, e.g. _SP 800-53A Rev. 1_

`:obsoleted-by:`::
One or more corresponding NIST document that this NIST document standard is obsoleted by; requires that
this document is withdrawn, and no longer in effect. Comma delimited.
Format is document identifier, e.g. _SP 800-53A Rev. 1_.
Is the relation between a withdrawn draft, and the next draft in the approval process.

`:supersedes:`::
One or more NIST document that this NIST document standard supersedes; the superseded
document may still remain in effect. Comma delimited.
Format is document identifier, e.g. _SP 800-53A Rev. 1_

NOTE: The distinction between `obsoletes` and `supersedes` is the withdrawal date of the
original document (`obsoleted-date`); that means that the distinction is predictable given that external information.
The distinction between `obsoleted-by` and `superseded-by`, in the same way, is made by
the withdrawal date of the current document. Relaton does not differentiate between the two relations
for that reason.

`:superseded-by`::
One or more corresponding NIST document that this NIST document standard is superseded by;
this document may still remain in effect. Comma delimited.
Format is document identifier, e.g. _SP 800-53A Rev. 1_
Is *not* the relation between a withdrawn draft, and the next draft in the approval process
(since the earlier draft is automatically no longer in effect).

forward. If present, bibliographies are treated in the legacy manner: they are treated like appendixes,
and are given an appendix number according to where in the document they occur.

`:boilerplate-authority:`:: Nominate a Metanorma XML file encoding the authority statement of the document,
to overwrite the default authority statement included in the gem
(https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-nist/blob/main/lib/metanorma/nist/nist_intro.xml[`lib/metanorma/nist/nist_intro.xml`],
https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-nist/blob/main/lib/metanorma/nist/nist_intro_cswp.xml[`lib/asciidoctor/nist/nist_intro_cswp.xml`]),
in case the document is historical, and needs to be generated with a previous authority statement.
