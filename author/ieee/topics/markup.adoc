== Abstract

This standard is intended to promote and facilitate interoperability
between components of an automatic test system (e.g., between test
executive and diagnostic reasoner) where test results need to be shared.
----
====


=== Keywords

The keywords of the document are given as the comma-delimited `:keywords:`
document attribute (see link:/author/ieee/ref/document-attributes[Document attributes]).


=== Introduction

The introduction of the document is marked up as a clause with the title
"Introduction". The initial boxed text, "This introduction is not part of
P{designation}/D{draft_number}, Draft {document-type} for {par-title}" is
automatically generated and populated by Metanorma. Do not provide it.


=== Acknowledgements

If the document refers to any externally sourced content that require permission
or licensing acknowledgements, they are entered as a section with the title
"Acknowledgements".

The "Acknowledgements" section shall appear immediately after the
"Introduction", in accordance with the
https://standards.ieee.org/develop/drafting-standard/resources/[IEEE SA Style Manual (2021)].

NOTE: The placement of the "Acknowledgements" section differs in legacy
documents, some IEEE SA standards places it immediately before the
"Introduction".

=== Automatic generated content

The templated material ("boilerplate") of the document front matter is all
automatically provided by Metanorma:

* Front page: Copyright statement, license statement

* Second page: Contact information, ISBNs

* Important Notices and Disclaimers Concerning IEEE Standards Documents

* Participants statement (the membership of the various committees is provided
in a link:/author/ieee/topics/markup/#participants[Participants] clause)

* The note before the overview in amendments, indicating how formatting is to be
interpreted



// end::preliminary-ieee[]


[[participants]]
== Participants and contributors

// tag::participants-ieee[]
=== General

There are multiple types of contributors to an IEEE SA document, and the
document displays full provenance of where the document was developed, balloted
and eventually approved.

NOTE: Requirements of the "`Participants`" section is described in the IEEE
Style Manual, 11.5 "Participant lists".


Other than the basic information entered through the
link:/author/ieee/ref/document-attributes#document-contributors[document attributes on document contributors],
the participants and members are entered in the "`Participants`" section.

An IEEE SA document requires listing of all members of the:

* working group;
* balloting group, whether the group is of entity mode or individual mode;
* Standards Board (SASB), at the time of publishing the document;
* any additional groups or individuals involved in the development process.

The Participants section is provided by the official IEEE template. Additional
contributing groups and participants, if any, are permitted additions to
the basic text.

In Metanorma, the participants section is entered as a top level section.
The section contains paragraphs in the order specified in the above list.

The initial sentence before each of the Working Group, Balloting Group, and
Standards Board listings is automatically supplied by Metanorma, following the
defined pattern provided by the 2021 IEEE Style Manual.

____
The following members of the <individual/entity> balloting committee voted on
this <guide/recommended practice/standard>. Balloters may have voted for
approval, disapproval, or abstention.
____

where, the Metanorma-generated sentence describes the correct document type and
the type of balloting group.

The remainder of the content is provided in three subclauses of the
`== Participants` clause supplied by the author:

* `=== Working group`
* `=== Balloting group`, and
* `=== Standards board`:

NOTE: The first `== Participants` clause found in a document will be processed
for boilerplate content, and removed from the document by Metanorma.

NOTE: If you have an actual clause titled `== Participants` which needs to be
left alone, insert `[heading=clause]` before it to prevent it being recognised
as a metadata Participants clause.

[[representing-participants]]
=== Representing participants

Participants can be entered in the following manners:

* in an unordered list, where each list item is a personal name
+
.Example of representing individual participants in an unordered list
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
* Nikola Tesla
* Thomas Edison
* Henry Ford
----
====

* in a definition list, with the key `item` pointing to a name, as a personal name
+
.Example of representing individual participants in a definition list
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
item:: Claude Elwood Shannon
item:: Charles-Augustin de Coulomb
----
====

* in a two-level definition list, where the key `item` empty, with
sub-definitions containing key-value encoded attributes of the participant:

** `name` for persons
** `company` for entities
** `role` to describe the role of the participant.
When no `role` is provided, it is assumed to be "Member".

+
.Example of representing individual participants with roles and companies
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
item::
name::: Arthur C. Clark
role::: Chair
item::
name::: Alessandro Volta
role::: Vice-Chair
item::
company::: Apple Inc.
item:: Claude Elwood Shannon
item:: Charles-Augustin de Coulomb
----
====

Participant lists should be given in the order they will be rendered in:

* officers before members;
* organisation members before individual members.

Documents often insert additional lists of participants and acknowledgements.
Any list or definition list in the user-supplied Participants clause is treated
and processed the same way.

The Word and PDF rendering of the participants listings automatically works
out the differential rendering of member organisations and individual members in
two or three columns.


=== Working group

Working group participants are entered using the method in
<<representing-participants>>.

For an individual mode working group, participants are entered using
personal names.

[example]

For an entity mode working group, there are two types of participants:
entity representatives, and individuals.

Entity representative participants should be entered using both `name` with
`company`, and individual participants just with `name`.
Officers are to be entered with `name`, `role` and `company`.

=== Balloting group

Balloting group participants are entered using the method in
<<representing-participants>>.

There are two types of balloting groups.

In an individual working group, personal names are entered using the
`name` key.

=== Standards board

Standards board members are entered using the method in
<<representing-participants>>.

The IEEE SA Standards Board members are to be entered using `name` and
with `role` when appropriate. Member Emeritus is entered with attaching
an asterisk (`*`) at the end of the name.

The paragraph explaining the asterisk indicates Member Emeritus is inserted
automatically by Metanorma.

NOTE: The standards board membership is provided by the working group secretary
or the IEEE editor during editing. If the information is not provided in the
document, dummy values will be provided to match those in the IEEE templates.

=== Name markup

The forenames and surnames of participants should be marked up semantically as such,
for correct generation of Word styles. This is done with the markup
`span:surname[]`, `span:forename[]`, and [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ieee/releases/tag/v1.2.1].
There is no need to mark up the role of participants or their status as companies, as this is already semantically
differentiated in markup.

// end::participants-ieee[]

== Overview

The _Overview_ clause, and its subclauses are recognized automatically from the
supplied clause headers.

The subclauses recognized include:

* _Scope_
* _Purpose_
* _Word usage_

The _Word Usage_ subclause is mandatory for normal documents (as distinct from
amendments and corrigenda), and is auto-populated by Metanorma. There is no need
to encode it.

== References

The introductory paragraph for normative references and bibliographies is
automatically generated by Metanorma.

References are automatically sorted by Metanorma:

* Normative references are automatically sorted by designator.

* Bibliography references are automatically sorted by designators or author and
title.

Footnotes are automatically inserted for withdrawn IEEE references, and for references
from Standards Defining Organizations recognised in Relaton [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ieee/releases/tag/v1.1.11].

The bibliography is entered as a subclause of an annex: the bibliography
heading is overwritten by the annex heading, but it must still be given as
"Bibliography" to be recognised correctly.

[source,asciidoc]
----
[appendix]
== Bibliographic excursus

[bibliography]
=== Bibliography
----

== Definitions clause

// tag::definitions[]

=== General

Definitions are recognised as a clause with the title "Definitions" or "Terms
and definitions".

Definitions are automatically sorted by Metanorma in accordance with the
IEEE SA Style Manual.

The notation for subdefinitions and cross-references in Metanorma is
demonstrated in the following example.

Metanorma supports _concepts_, which capture terms are cross-referencable
entities, including cross-references within the Definitions sections.

NOTE: Highlighting and cross-referencing of concepts is not supported in
Metanorma for IEEE, in accordance with the IEEE SA Style Manual.


.Example with abbreviated term, multiple definitions and concept relations
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]

preferred:[WgT]
related:contrast[thing] // Contrast:
related:seealso[whatsit] // See also:

----

renders as:

____
*widget (WgT)*: *(A)* device performing an unspecified function. *(B)* general
metasyntactic variable. _See also:_ whatsit. _Contrast:_ thing.
____
====


=== Multiple definitions

IEEE SA documents supports multiple definitions per term.

Each definition is encoded using the `[.definition]` block.

.Example with multiple definitions (IEEE SA Style Manual 2021)
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
=== output

[.definition]
Data that has been processed.

[.definition]
The process of transferring data from an internal storage device to an external
storage device.
----

renders as:

____
*output:* *(A)* Data that has been processed. *(B)* The process of transferring
data from an internal storage device to an external storage device.
____
====


=== Concept relations

==== Synonyms

Synonyms are entered using `preferred:[...]` or `admitted:[...]`.

A preferred term is intended to introduce equally valid term designations, such
as abbreviations and acronyms such as acronyms. Preferred terms are encoded
`+preferred[...]+`.
These are displayed in parentheses after the initial term.

An admitted term is intended for synonyms. Admitted terms are encoded using
`+admitted:[...]+`.
These are displayed using the concept relation _See:_, where an additional term
is automatically inserted into the clause.

NOTE: _See:_ terms are the opposite relations to _Syn:_ relations, and the
generated relation will point the _See:_ term's definition back at the original
term. Please _do not_ manually insert markup for _See:_ terms.

.Example of definition with _See:_ (IEEE SA Style Manual 2021)
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
=== coded character set
admitted:[code set]

A set of characters for which coded representation exist.
----

renders as:

____
*code set:* _See:_ *coded character set*.

*coded character set:* A set of characters for which coded representation exist.
_Syn:_ code set.
____

----

renders as:

____
*doovywhack*: _See:_ widget.

*widget (WgT)*: device performing an unspecified function. _Syn:_ doovywhack.
____
====

==== Contrast

A contrasting term is one that describes an opposite meaning to the designated
definition.

.Term encoded with _Contrast:_ (IEEE SA Style Manual 2021)

----

renders as:

____
*acceleration-insensitive drift rate:* The component of systematic drift rate
that has no correlation with acceleration. _See also:_ *drift rate*;
*systematic drift rate*.
____
====


==== Equivalence

An equivalent term is meant to cross-reference pre-existing term definitions.

Equivalent terms are encoded using the relation `related:equivalent[...]`.



=== Term sources

Term sources are encoded using the `[.source]` syntax, and rendered within
parentheses after the definition according to the IEEE SA Style Manual.

.Example on encoding term source (IEEE SA Style Manual 2021)
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]

specific operating conditions. (IEEE Std 260.1-2004)
____
====

For terms that are modified or adapted from the source, they are encoded as
"adapted from" through an `adapted` option on the source tag.

.Example on encoding an adapted term source (IEEE Style Manual 2021)
[example]
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
=== drift rate

==== License notes on term sources

When a term is sourced from ISO, the IEEE SA applies to ANSI for a license grant to incorporate the content,
and ANSI grants IEEE SA a license to incorporate, subject to acknowledgement in the document. This
is rendered as a footnote, appearing after the term source. In markup, this is entered as a term note of
type `license` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ieee/releases/tag/v1.5.3]:

=== Tables

Table heads and table subheads are marked up as header cells. They are differentiated by line break:

[source,asciidoc]
----
|===
| Header1 | Header2

h| Table Row Head +
Table Row Subhead | Value
|===
----


== Inline

=== Cross-references

Omission of "clause" at the start of a sentence for cross-references to
subclauses is done automatically by Metanorma. If Metanorma's detection of the
start of a sentence is incorrect, you can override Metanorma's auto-generated
text, by providing it explicitly within the cross-reference, e.g.
`<<xref1,Clause 3.1>>`.

References to the bibliography are automatically populated by designator and
bibliographic number (e.g. _ISO 639-2, [B1]_), if the reference is to a standard
or technical report, or otherwise by author and bibliographic number.

The IEEE Style Manual allows either author or title to be used as a reference to
the bibliography.

A switch to a different rendered reference style can be set using the `style=`
option on the
cross-reference [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ieee/releases/tag/v1.5.4]:

* `style=title`: References are rendered by title. This is the default for
references that are not standards or technical reports.

* `style=authors`: References are rendered by author names.

[example]
====
For a book citation, `<<eref1,style=title%>>` would give _Demystifying Deep
Learning: An Introduction to the Mathematics of Neural Networks [B1]_,
====

[example]
====
`<<eref1,style=author%>>` or `<<eref1>>` would give _Douglas [B1]_.
====


References to the bibliography that have render text supplied are by default
assumed to be using a variant form of the title or of author names. Metanorma
will automatically append the bibliographic number after them.

[example]
====
`<<eref,Studies on perpendicularity>>` will be rendered as _Studies on
perpendicularity [B1]_. (assuming the bibliographic number is B1).
====

It is possible to override this behavior to treat the supplied text as running
text instead of a citation.

The method to do so is to supply the style option of `style=no-biblio-tag%`
before the render text
 [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ieee/releases/tag/v1.5.4].

NOTE: In HTML output, a suppressed bibliographic number will still have the
citation text hyperlink to the relevant point in the bibliography.

[example]
====
`<<eref,style=no-biblio-tag%the aforementioned study>>` will render as _the
aforementioned study_.
====


=== Footnotes

If a footnote is repeated, Metanorma automatically detects that and converts it
into a cross-reference ("See Footnote 1.")

A repeat footnote can be marked up using the `footnote` macro target (`abc` in
the following example; any identifier can be used), and with the repeat footnote
text left blank.

[source,asciidoc]
----
Hello.footnote:abc[This is a footnote]

Repetition.footnote:abc[]
----

== Validation

Metanorma issues warnings for the document against the following rules from the
Style Manual:

* The title of the document starts as "(Draft) (Trial-Use)
(Standards|Recommended Practice|Guide)" (11.3). This is done automatically by
Metanorma if all the relevant document attributes are populated.

* The title contains no uncapitalized words other than prepositions (11.3).

* No cross-reference ranges are used: "See Figure 1, Figure 2 and Figure 3", not
"See Figures 1 through 3" (17.2). This is only checked against autonumbered
cross-references.

* Undated references should not contain identify specific elements of the
referenced text (12.3.2).

* Normative references should be dated (12.3.1).

* There should be no more than one ordered list within a numbered clause (13.3).

* The names of supplied images in figures and tables must follow the prescribed
naming conventions (17.1).

* Figure headings should be capitalized (17.2).

* The document must contain an Overview clause, a Scope clause, a Word Usage
clause (12.2).

* The Overview clause must occur first, and contain the Scope clause and the
Word Usage clause (12.2).

* There should be no more than five levels of subclauses (13.1).

* No subclause should be the only child of its parent (13.1).

* Decimal comma should not be used (14.2).

* Decimals must have a leading zero if less than 1 (14.2).

* There must be space before the percent sign (14.2).

* There must be space between numerals and recognised SI units (14.2).

* Units must be given on both value and tolerance for an SI unit (14.2).

* Numbers occurring in tables should be broken up in threes, unless they are
four-digit sequences and all other digits are at most three digits (16.3.2).

* Table headings and header cells should be capitalized (16.2).

* The document should contain Normative Refences and Definitions (12.2).

* The bibliography should be either the first or the last annex of the document
(19.1).

* Amendment/corrigenda changes should start with one of _Change_, _Insert_, _Delete_,
_Replace_, reflecting the kind of change involved (20.2.2). [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-ieee/releases/tag/v0.1.0]

* Unordered lists should be no more than two levels deep.

* Ordered lists should be no more than five levels deep.
