== General

The header contains information about the document (metadata). You specify these
metadata by using predefined document attributes, that look like this:

[source,adoc]
----
:document-attribute: some-value
----

Most of the attributes take a value, while others are simple flags without a
value, like:

[source,adoc]
----
:novalid:
----

Some of the metadata will be visible in your document, such as `:title:`, while
others are not visible but still affect how your document is generated.

NOTE: The order of attributes does not matter in Metanorma.

== Specifying IEEE metadata

In an IEEE SA document, you can specify metadata about:

* Contributors: working group participants, ballot group members, standardization board members

* Document info: document type, document stages (draft, published, etc.).

* Dates: draft dates, revision dates, publishing date, copyright year, etc.

* Identifiers: document numbers, ISBNs, STD numbers

NOTE: Other metadata influence how the document is generated and should only be
used by advanced users. Please refer to the IEEE SA document attributes.

At a minimum, you will need to specify:

* Title
* Metanorma document class as `ieee`
* Document number
* Document type, and optionally subtype
* Document stage
* Committee
* Author or editor

NOTE: Please refer to reference documentation to see the full list of
link:/author/ieee/ref/document-attributes/[IEEE SA-specific document attributes].

NOTE: In this section we use the document header from the
https://github.com/metanorma/mn-samples-ieee/blob/main/sources/p987.6/document.adoc[IEEE Style Manual document example]
to explain.

// IEEE SA example
== Document-specific attributes and basic operations

These are the basic document attributes for IEEE SA.

.Setting basic document attributes for IEEE SA
[example]
====
----
= Recommended Practice for Preparing an IEEE Standards Draft <1>
:docnumber: 987.6 <2>
:docstage: draft <3>
:version: 3 <4>
----
<1> IEEE SA document title.
<2> IEEE SA document number. If draft, omit the "P" prefix as it will be
automatically added.
<3> IEEE SA document stage.
<4> If `:docstage:` is draft, enter the draft number in `:version:`.
====

These are operational concerns that are useful for the author.

* `:mn-document-class:` must be set in order to set the flavor to IEEE SA.

* `:mn-output-extensions:` determines what output to be produced.

.Setting IEEE SA-specific attributes
[example]
====
----
:mn-document-class: ieee <1>
:mn-output-extensions: xml,html,doc,pdf,rxl <2>
:local-cache-only: <3>
----
<1> Metanorma flavor. For IEEE SA, enter `ieee`.
<2> Metanorma output formats. For IEEE SA, supported formats are `xml`, `html`, `pdf`, `doc` and `rxl`.
<3> Metanorma option to store data cache in the current directory.
====


== Document types and subtypes

IEEE SA offers three types of documents that differ in the level of
the obligation of requirements.


The type is to be set via these two attributes:

`:doctype:`:: for the document type

`:docsubtype:`:: for the document subtype, necessary for certain `:doctypes:`

Document types, set using the `:doctype:` attribute, include:

`standard`:: This document is a Standard (default). This document provides
mandatory requirements.

`recommended-practice`:: This document is a Recommended Practice. This document
only provides recommendations, not requirements.

`guide`:: This document is a Guide. This document only provide guidelines, not
requirements.

For each of these types, modification documents can be issued by using
`:docsubtype:` with the following values:

`document`:: This document is the standardization deliverable itself. (default)

`amendment`:: This document details amendments made to the base document.

`corrigendum`:: This document details technical error corrections made to the base document.

`errata`:: This document details publication error corrections made to the base document.

.Setting document type
[example]
====
----
:doctype: standard <1>
----
<1> IEEE SA document type.
====

.Setting document type with subtype for an Amendment
[example]
====
----
:doctype: standard
:docsubtype: amendment <1>
----
<1> IEEE SA document subtype.
====


== Document stages and progress dates

IEEE SA deliverables go through various stages of approval.

The document stage is set via the `:docstage:` attribute.

Typically, a document goes through these processes:

. Started off as a draft. where `:docstage: draft` is set, and draft number set
to 1 `:version: 1`. The `:copyright-year:` should always be set to the current year.

. Draft number increases, e.g. `:version: 2`, as the working group progresses.

. The draft gets balloted by the working group when ready.

. Once the balloting group approves the document, it will be represented
to the SA standardization board for approval.

. After approval, the date of approval should be entered as metadata
using `:issued-date:`.

. Once the document is ready to be published, set `:docstage: published` and
remove the `:version:` attribute.

NOTE: IEEE SA documents can also be marked `inactive` by `:docstage: inactive`.

.Setting document stage and progress dates
[example]
====
----
:docstage: draft <1>
:version: 3 <2>
:copyright-year: 2021 <3>
:issued-date: 2021-01-01 <4>
----
<1> Document stage.
<2> Document draft number.
<3> Copyright year of document.
<4> Date of approval by the standards board.
====

== Authorship and other preface information

In IEEE SA documents there are several types of contributor information to be
entered:

* society name
* standardization committee
* working group information
** name of working group
** members of working group
* balloting committee members
* SA standardization board members

All membership information is encoded in a participants clause.


// The individual contributors that created the document, this is set via the
// `:fullname:` and `:role:` attributes. Additional contributors are set by
// suffixing the attribute with a `_{n}` where {n} is a sequential number after 1,
// e.g. For `:fullname_2:` use `:role_2:`.


.Usage of authorship information outside of memberships
[example]
====
----
:society: Computer Society <1>
:committee: C/AISC - Artificial Intelligence Standards Committee <2>
:working-group: Spatial Web Working Group <3>
----
<1> IEEE Society.
<2> IEEE Committee sponsor of the document.
<3> IEEE SA working group that produces the document.

== Participants and contributors

// tag::participants-ieee[]

include::author/ieee/topics/markup.adoc[tag=participants-ieee]

== Table of contents: figures and tables

In IEEE SA documents, a list of figures and tables are often provided in the
TOC.

The following Metanorma setting will enable these tables of contents.

.Enabling figures and tables in the Table of Contents
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
:toc-figures: true <1>
:toc-tables: true <2>
----
<1> Enables the TOC for figures.
<2> Enables the TOC for tables.
====

== Other metadata

Every IEEE SA document has a list of keywords (for searching purposes)
and is also issued identifiers like the ISBN.

This information can be set as follows.

.Setting other identifying metadata
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
:keywords: data fusion, IEEE 2830â„¢, shared machine learning, SML, ... <1>
:isbn-pdf: 978-1-5044-7724-6 <2>
:isbn-print: 978-1-5044-7725-3 <3>
:stdid-pdf: STD24807 <4>
:stdid-print: STDPD24807 <5>
----
<1> List of keywords, comma-delimited.
<2> ISBN-13 for the PDF version.
<3> ISBN-13 for the printed version.
<4> STDID for the PDF version.
<5> STDID for the printed version.
