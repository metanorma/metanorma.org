= Metanorma IEEE SA document attributes

[[note_general_doc_ref_doc_attrib_ieee]]
[NOTE]
====
Document attributes listed below are unique to the processing of IEEE SA documents
in Metanorma.

For _common document attributes_, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[Document attributes reference] in general Metanorma author's documentation. That page describes attributes that apply to all Metanorma flavors, not just IEEE SA.

For an _introduction to Metanorma AsciiDoc document attributes_ and how Metanorma uses them, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[the corresponding topic].

[[document-contributors]]
== Document contributors

=== General

There are multiple types of contributors to an IEEE SA document, and the
document displays full provenance of where the document was developed, balloted
and eventually approved.

The basic information of these groups are entered as document attributes,
including:

* the working group
* the balloting group
* the standards board, at the time of publishing the document.

Members of these groups are entered in the
link:/author/ieee/topics/markup#participants[Participants clause].


=== Society

An IEEE SA document is sponsored by or developed by an IEEE society.
This IEEE society is prominently displayed on the cover page.

NOTE: This is mandatory information.

`society`:: The IEEE society responsible for the document. Do not include the
"IEEE" prefix.
+
.Example for IEEE SA `society`
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
:society: Computer Society
----
====

=== Committee

An IEEE SA document is developed within a working group under an IEEE SA
committee.
This IEEE SA committee is prominently displayed on the cover page.

NOTE: This is mandatory information.

`committee`:: The committee responsible for the document.
+
.Example for IEEE SA `committee`
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
:committee: C/AISC - Artificial Intelligence Standards Committee
----
====
+
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
:committee: Standards Activities Board
----
====


=== Working group

An IEEE SA document is developed by a working group.

NOTE: This is mandatory information.

An IEEE SA working group can be one of two modes
(more details at link:/author/ieee/ref/process[process]):

* Entity-based: members are IEEE SA member organizations
* Individual-based: members are individual contributors

`working-group`:: The working group responsible for the document.
Include any final "Working Group" text in the group name.
+
.Example for IEEE SA `working-group`
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
:working-group: Spatial Web Working Group
----
====

(Rendered as: _the Spatial Web Working Group had the following membership:..._)

Members of the working group are to be listed in the
link:/author/ieee/topics/markup#participants[Participants clause].


=== Balloting group

The balloting group, or balloting committee, is the group that recommends
the document for approval as a standard by the IEEE SA Standardization board.

The balloting group is composed of voting members of the working group, or the
committee that the working group belongs to.

`balloting-group`:: The Standards Association balloting group responsible for the document.
Do not supply the final "Standards Association balloting group" text in the group name;
that is supplied by Metanorma.

`balloting-group-type`:: The type of the Standards Association balloting group responsible for the document,
_individual_ or _entity_ (default: _individual_).

Members of the balloting group are to be listed in the
link:/author/ieee/topics/markup#participants[Participants clause].


=== Standardization board

The IEEE Standardization Board at the time of document publication is rendered
in the document preface.

Members of the IEEE SA Standardization Board (SASB) are to be listed in the
link:/author/ieee/topics/markup#participants[Participants clause].

=== Personal authors

White papers require personal authors to be specified, as follows:

`:surname:`, `:surname_2:`, `:surname_{i}:`::
Surname of personal authors

`:givenname:`, `:givenname_2:`, `:givenname_{i}:`::
Given name of personal authors

`:contributor-position:`, `:contributor-position_2:`, `:contributor-position_{i}:`::
Job title of personal authors



=== Sponsors

The sponsoring bodies, if any, are indicated through the `:sponsor:` and
`:sponsor-subdivision:` attributes.

As with other author values, multiple instances of sponsoring organisations and
their subdivisions are indicated as `:sponsor_2:` and `:sponsor-subdivision_2:`,
`:sponsor_3:` and `:sponsor-subdivision_3:`, etc.

The values of `:sponsor-subdivision_{i}:` can be:

* multiple (semicolon-delimited: processed via CSV, recognising quote marks)
* hierarchical, with multiple levels of subdivision (comma-delimited, from larger to
  smaller) [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.8.3];

The different hierarchical levels can optionally be prefixed with type and a colon.

On the front cover, if it is a sponsor, "IEEE" is prefixed to the first
subdivision, rather than being rendered on a separate line.

The following is an example of how two divisions of the IEEE are indicated as sponsoring the document:

.IEEE subdivsion sponsors to a document
====
[source,adoc]
----
:sponsor: IEEE
:sponsor-subdivision: "Power & Energy Society", Power System Communications Committee; Communications Society, Standards Committee
----

rendered as:

____
Sponsored by the +
*Power System Communications Committee* +
of the +
*IEEE Power & Energy Society* +
and the +
*Standards Committee* +
of the +
*IEEE Communications Society*
____
====

NOTE: The quotation marks are needed to process the CSV correctly.


== Visual appearance

`:hierarchical-object-numbering:`::
If set, do not number tables and figures consecutively throughout the body of the
document, but restart numbering with each clause (hierarchically).
+
Use in complex documents, with multiple tables or figures, that need to be tracked against
clauses for ease of lookup (so _Figure 6-3, Figure 6-4_, instead of _Figure 21, Figure 22_.)

== Document processing

`:ieee-dtd:`::
The location of the IEEE XML DTD [added in https://github.com/metanorma/isodoc/releases/tag/v0.1.0].
Used to validate any IEEE XML generated for the document.
