= Syntax for writing UN documents using Metanorma

== Document header attributes

[NOTE]
====
The document attributes listed below are unique to Metanorma's processing of UN documents.

For _common document attributes_, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[Document attributes reference] in general Metanorma author's documentation. That page describes attributes that apply to all Metanorma flavors, not just UN.

For an _introduction to Metanorma AsciiDoc document attributes_ and how Metanorma uses them, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[the corresponding topic].
====

`:doctype:`:: The document type
(see _UN deliverables: The different types of UN publications_) (mandatory).

metadata attributes are given
[added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-un/releases/tag/v0.3.4].

== Preface

=== General

The Foreword and Introduction are not recognised as part of the document preface
by default [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-un/releases/tag/v0.3.4].

=== Abstract

Abstracts are moved to the front page in Plenary documents.
In Recommendation documents, they appear in the document preface,
before the foreword and introduction.

== Paragraph numbering

Paragraphs are automatically numbered -- paragraph numbers should not
be entered in the Metanorma AsciiDoc source.

Paragraphs are numbered by treating each paragraph in the Metanorma XML as a separate clause;
all terminal clauses in UN Metanorma XML are rendered as a numbered paragraph.

Non-paragraph blocks (tables, figures, admonitions,  lists) are not numbered;
nor are paragraphs in prefatory material (introduction, foreword, abstract).

== Notes

Different note types can be
entered [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-un/releases/tag/v0.3.11]:

* Source notes using the note type `source`;
* Abbreviation notes using the note type `abbreviation`.


[example]
.Example of specifying a source NOTE in a UN document

== Footnotes

Titles may be entered with footnotes [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-un/releases/tag/v0.5.5]:

[source,asciidoc]
--
:title: Paperless Trade White Paper footnote:[text1], footnote:[text2]
--




== Admonitions

The admonition container `IMPORTANT` is used to render UN document boxes.

Unlike normal Metanorma admonitions, UN admonitions can have titles, and
can be numbered in output. As with other assets in Metanorma, the option
attribute `unnumbered` can be applied to prevent an admonition being numbered.
(So `[IMPORTANT%unnumbered]` or `[IMPORTANT,options="unnumbered"]`.)

.Business Process Analysis Plus (BPA+)   (<==== This is the box title)
====
Business Process Analysis was initially designed to document and
evaluate an import/export process at a given point time and its
relative simplicity. It also specifically includes a measurement of the
time and cost of the complete range of procedures as one of the main
outputs of the analysis. This combination makes it suitable as the
basis/core of a trade facilitation monitoring and improvement system.
