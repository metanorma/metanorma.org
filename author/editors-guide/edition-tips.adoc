The following tips complement the information in:
link:/author/ref/asciidoc-tips/[Metanorma AsciiDoc tips].

== Use lowercase image filenames

Some platforms have file systems that have case-sensitive filenames.

Linux uses case-sensitive file systems, i.e. `image.PNG` and `image.png` are
different file names.

.Impact of mixed-case filenames across platforms
[example]
====
If you have a file named `image.PNG` and use `image::image.png[]`
to include the image, it will work on macOS and Windows, but will fail on Linux.

On Linux, Metanorma will fail to find the specified `image.png`.
====

The best practice is to keep all filenames in lowercase to ensure that the
document is portable across platforms.


If you are on Windows, and have multiple filenames ending in `.PNG`, there is a
straightforward way to change them all at once:

. Go to the folder where the images are located.

. Place the cursor in the bar address, write `cmd` and press ENTER. The command
line will open on that folder location.

. In the command line, execute the command `ren ++*++.PNG ++*++.png`,
and all `++*++.PNG` files will be renamed as `*.png`.


== Using different math expression languages

Math expressions can be written in the AsciiMath, LaTeX math, UnicodeMath
formats. The default math language in Metanorma is AsciiMath,
accepted by `stem:[...]` command and in the `[stem]` block.

There are two ways to use alternative math languages.

. Use math language specific commands:

** AsciiMath:: `asciimath:[...]`, `[stem,lang=asciimath]`
** LaTeX math:: `latexmath:[...]`, `[stem,lang=latexmath]`
** UnicodeMath:: `unicodemath:[...]`, `[stem,lang=unicodemath]`

. Change the default math language for the whole document through the `:stem:`
document attribute.

* AsciiMath:: `:stem: asciimath`.
* LaTeX math:: `:stem: latexmath`.
* UnicodeMath:: `:stem: unicodemath`.


While the AsciiMath default and can handle most cases, as not all symbols and
expressions are available in AsciiMath.

.Unavailable symbols in AsciiMath
[example]
====
The `\backepsilon` (‚àç) and `\mathbb{E}` (ùîº) symbols are not available in
AsciiMath, amongst others.
====

== Verify math formulas before encoding in Metanorma

Metanorma relies on https://www.plurimath.org[Plurimath] to render the correct
math presentation of all math representation languages.

If you are not familiar with the expression of math in the math representation
language, or are unsure how it wil be rendered, do take time to check
the formula on the https://www.plurimath.org[Plurimath] website, which provides
you with a converter to verify the output of the formula.

Especially pay attention to the "math tree", which indicates how the formula
is understood by a computer, such that the intended semantics are correctly
encoded.


== Do not use math arrays

The LaTeX `eqnarray` environment for equation arrays is not supported by
https://github.com/plurimath/plurimath[Plurimath]. Users are encouraged to use
multiple formula blocks instead in order for every equation to be individually
numbered.


// TODO: re-write the text below to use Plurimath CLI software instead, when it's ready:
// https://github.com/plurimath/plurimath/issues/204
////
If you want to know if an equation will pass, try this:

`math.lxml`
[source,latex]
----
V = \frac{1}{2} \: {\bf u}^t \:
            \int_{surface} \: {B'}^t \: D' \: B' \: ds
               \; {\bf u}
----

Run:

[source,sh]
----
cat math.lxml | latexmlmath -
----
////

== Keep table formatting at the top level

AsciiDoc provides flexibility in formatting individual table cells by prefixing
them with corresponding markup elements.

When a table column shares the same formatting requirements,
the formatting options can be specified at column specification. These include:

* cell alignment
* cell width

The example below demonstrates the usage of the _specifier_, which left-aligns
the first column and prefixes all its cells with a to interpret the content as
AsciiDoc. The second column is horizontally centered, and the third column is
right-aligned. Additionally, a header option is added to the table.

.Using table column specifiers for alignment
====
[source,asciidoc]
----
[cols="<a,^,>",options="header"]
|===
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3

| left aligned | centered | right aligned
|===
----
====

NOTE: The table header is always separated from table content by a blank line,
in order to allow long tables spanning pages to properly render table headers
repeated on every new page.

== Unnumbered elements

The attribute `%unnumbered` is used to prevent Metanorma from assigning unique
numbers to elements.

Elements that can be unnumbered include:

* equation blocks
* figures
* tables
* notes
* examples
* and code blocks.

NOTE: Clauses and subclauses cannot be unnumbered.

.Unnumbered image

== Removing title from sections and subsections

To remove section and subsection titles, use the sequence `\{blank}` as its
title.

.Untitled section headings
====
[source,adoc]
----
//Blank section
== {blank}
Text

//Blank subsection
=== {blank}
Text
----
====



== Escaping control characters

AsciiDoc uses certain control characters to denote formatting and structure.

To render these control characters literally, the backslash (`\`) character can
be used to "escape" them.

However, there are cases where the standard backslash escaping approach does not
work as expected, due to the inherent ambiguity of the AsciiDoc syntax.

For instance, if you want to display a double hyphen `--` instead of an em-dash
`‚Äî`, the backslash method (`\--`) will not achieve the desired result.

In such situations, you can use the _Zero Width Non Joiner_ entity `\&#x200c;`
to obtain the correct output. The formatted double hyphen would appear as
`-\&#x200c;-`.

Generally, authors should first attempt to escape characters using the
backslash, and if that proves ineffective, resort to using the `\&#x200c;`
entity instead.

== Proper usage of normative references

The _Normative references_ clause in Metanorma documents is a specific section
reserved for citing external sources that are considered authoritative for the
content.

It is important to note that the use of numeric references (e.g.,
`[[[netcdf,1]]]`) is not permitted within this section.

If a reference cannot be automatically fetched using a standard identifier as
the reference tag, authors should use alternative textual descriptions to
identify the source.

.Using alternative textual descriptions in the bibliography
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
[bibliography]
== Normative references

* [[[netcdf,LLNL NetCDF CF Metadata Conventions]]],
span:title[NetCDF CF Metadata Conventions].
span:organization[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory].
span:uri:citation[http://cfconventions.org/]
----
====

Numeric references are only permitted within the _Bibliography_ clause, which
can include both generic and standard references.

Failure to adhere to this convention may result in compilation errors or
incorrect document generation, depending on the specific AsciiDoc flavor being
used (e.g., OGC). Authors are encouraged to consult the Metanorma documentation
for more information on composing references and bibliographies in AsciiDoc.

For more information about composing references and bibliography,
see: link:/author/topics/sections/bibliography/[Bibliography]

== Autogenerate Section IDs are no longer supported -- Always assign custom IDs

In original AsciiDoc, section IDs can be automatically generated based on the
title of the section. Meaning that, for a section titled "Section title",
the ID would be `section_title`. Allowing you to reference the section as
`<<section_title>>` without having to assign a custom ID.

This feature, commonly known as
https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/sections/auto-ids/[sectids],
is no longer supported in Metanorma. Therefore, you must always assign a
custom ID to any section referenced elsewhere in the document.

.Invalid section ID
====
[source,adoc]
--
== Section title
This section has no custom ID, and cannot be referenced using sectids, i.e.
`<<section_title>>` or `<<section_title,Section title>>`.
--
====

.Valid section ID
====
[source,adoc]
--
[[section_custom_id]]
== Section title
This section has a custom ID, and can be referenced as
`<<section_custom_id>>` or `<<section_custom_id,Section title>>`.
