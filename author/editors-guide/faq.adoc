== How can I nest additional content to a list item?

Sometimes list items contain more content than a simple paragraph.

A list item can be attached with an open block to contain additional content.

An open block is a block of text delimited with lines consisting of two hyphen
symbols `--` at the beginning and end.

.Example of an open block
====
[source,adoc]
----
--
This is an open block
--
----
====

The concatenation character `+` is used to join the open block to the list,
the `+` is to be placed immediately after the list item, and immediate before
the open block, with no gap in between.

.Example of an open block joined to a list item
====
[source,adoc]
.List item with block concatenation
----
. This line is a list item.
+
--
And this line is concatenated to the list item by using an open block.
--
----

You can basically put any markup into the concatenated open block: paragraphs,
notes, examples, tables, lists, etc.


== How can I include rich-text elements in a table?

Rich-text elements are allowed in a table cell.

The table cell that contains rich-text content has to denoted as "rich-text"
through using the `a` column option in `cols`, or prefixed with an `a` immediate
before the cell delimiter.

// Including an unnumbered figure
a|
[%unnumbered]
image::image01.png[]

// Including an item list
a|
Some text

* item 1
* item 2

|===
----

NOTE: When including an item list in a table cell, as with normal cases, a blank
line needs to precede the first asterisk (`*`) or dot (`.`) used as an indicator
for the first item on a list.


== Why do I get extremely wide tables in DOC output sometimes?

This could happen when there are table cells containing a string of long text
that has no whitespace in between, causing the table wider beyond borders.

* If the long text is a URL, specify the `:break-up-urls-in-tables:` document
attribute in the document header to allow Metanorma to cut up URLs when needed.
