=== Participant clauses

The membership of the investigative committee for the standard appears before
the table of contents in JIS documents, in tabular form.

By default, the title of the participant clause includes the name of the investigative
committee, and is generated automatically; for that to happen, the title of the clause
must be left blank, as `{blank}`..

NOTE: The name of the investigative committee is set as a
link:/author/jis/ref/document-attributes/[document attribute].

The title of the participant clause is overridden by providing an explicit title for it.
This is necessary if there are more than one participant clauses 
in the document [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-jis/releases/tag/v0.4.4].

This information is entered in a YAML table within a clause of type
`participants`, with the following structure:

[source,asciidoc]
-----
[type=participants]
== {blank}

[source,yaml]
----
- name:
    surname: Surname 1
    givenname: Given Name 1
  affiliation: Affiliation 1
  role: Role 1 [optional]
- name:
    surname: Surname 2
    givenname: Given Name 2
  affiliation: Affiliation 2
  role: Role 2 [optional]
