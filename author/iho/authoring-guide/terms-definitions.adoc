== General

//General Metanorma AsciiDoc

Every IHO standard requires a "`Definitions`" clause to hold terminology
entries important to the standard.

The "`Definitions`" section provides a single point of truth for terms
and concepts used within this standard.

NOTE: The "`Definitions`" clause is called by various names in other SDOs, for
instance, at IHO, ISO and IEC it is "`Terms and definitions`".


== Terminology models

Terminology entries in IHO adhere to the terminology specifications described
in the ISO/IEC Directives Part 2.

In Metanorma, the underlying terminology entries adhere to the international
standard for terminology representation, ISO 10241-1, which is a superset of the
IHO terminology requirements and therefore fully supports the expression of
them.


== Definitions clauses

An IHO document uses one of the following clause structures.

A typical definitions clause, which does not provide additional acronyms and
abbreviations, looks like this:

* 3. Definitions

The Metanorma AsciiDoc encoding for this structure is demonstrated below.

.Defining the Definitions clause
[example]
====

[source,adoc]
----
== Definitions

=== acceleration-insensitive drift rate
related:seealso[drift rate]
related:seealso[systematic drift rate]

The component of...

=== code set
related:see[coded character set]

=== coded character set
related:equivalent[code set]

A set of characters.

=== drift rate
The slope at a stated time of...

[.source%adapted]
<<iso-iec_9945-1>>

*3. Definitions*

For the purposes of this document, the following terms and definitions apply.
The IHO Standards Dictionary Online should be consulted for terms not defined
in this clause.

*acceleration-insensitive drift rate*: The component of ... _See also_: *drift rate*; *systematic drift rate*.

*code set*: _See_: *coded character set*.

*coded character set*: A set of characters ... _Syn_: *code set*.

*drift rate*: The slope at a stated time of ... (adapted from ISO/IEC 9945-1:2003).
____
====

When the document provides additional acronyms and abbreviations, the definition
clause needs to be structured as follows:

A combined definitions and acronyms structure:

* 3 Definitions, acronyms, and abbreviations
* 3.1 Definitions
* 3.2 Acronyms and abbreviations


The sample Metanorma AsciiDoc encoding is shown below.

Terms and concepts that are referred to from the "`Definitions`" clause, such as
from concept relationships, but not defined in a document, must already be
available in the
https://iho.int/en/hdcg[IHO Hydrographic Dictionary] (at
https://iho.int/en/hdcg).

Optionally, if there are informative terminology entries, IHO allows
a "`Glossary`" section to be set in an Annex, which only consists of
informative terms.


== Entering terminology entries

There are in general the following kinds of terms:

* Terms that are newly defined in this document;

* Terms that are entirely sourced from another document;

* Terms that are sourced from another document but modified within this
  standard.

// * Terms that are in the IHO Standards Dictionary Online.

A newly defined term:

[source,adoc]
----
==== coded character set <1>
related:equivalent[code set] <2>

A {{set}} of {{character,character}}s. <3>

----
<1> `coded character set` provides the term to be defined.
<2> `related:equivalent[code set]` indicates that the defined term has
an `equivalent` relationship with the term `code set`.
<3> Text here provides the definition of the term. `{{set}}` here refers
to another term defined within the document. `{{character,characters}}` here
indicate that the term "character" is defined in this document.

A sourced term:

[source,adoc]
----
==== systematic drift rate

That component of drift rate that...

[.source]
<<IHO_Std_260.1>> <1>
----
<1> Term is sourced but no modification is done.


A sourced but adapted (modified) term looks like this:

[source,adoc]
----
==== drift rate

The slope at a stated time of...

[.source%adapted] <1>
<<iso-iec_9945-1>>
----
<1> The `%adapted` option indicates that the definition has been modified.

NOTE: Different from the sourcing of terms in other SDOs, the exact
modifications made are not elaborated in IHO documents.


== Acronyms and abbreviations

=== As part of a defined term

In IHO documents, acronyms and abbreviations can be assigned to terms
as according to the IHO Style Manual, 12.5 "Acronyms and abbreviations".

In order to encode acronyms or abbreviations in the terminological entry,
the following syntax is to be used.

.Encoding a defined term with an acronym or abbreviation
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
==== input reference axis

[%metadata]
abbreviation-type:: initialism

preferred:[IRA]

The direction of an axis.
----

Renders as:

[quote]
____
**input reference axis (IPA)**: The direction of an axis.
____
====

=== As a separate clause

As per IHO Style Manual, 12.5 "Acronyms and abbreviations",
acronyms and abbreviations can be shown as a separate clause.

.Encoding a defined term with an acronym or abbreviation
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
// This should be placed as Clause 3.2, after Clause 3.1 "Definitions"
=== Acronyms and abbreviations

DER:: distributed emission regeneration
DIS:: distributed interactive simulation
----

Renders as:

____
*3.2 Acronyms and abbreviations*

[cols="1,1"]
|===

|DER | distributed emission regeneration
|DIS | distributed interactive simulation

____
====

== Term relationships

A defined term may define links to other defined terms in the document or to
terms in the https://iho.int/en/hdcg[IHO Hydrographic Dictionary].

The allowed relationships are codified in IHO Style Manual, 12.4
"Definitions", being:

[quote,IHO Style Manual, 12.4 "Definitions"]
____
Cross-references should occur after the definition and may consist of the
following classes, in the order shown: Contrast:, Syn:, See:, and See also:.
Contrast: refers to a term with an opposite or substantially different meaning.
Syn: refers to a synonymous term. See: refers to a term where the desired
definition can be found. See also: refers to a related term. The
cross-references listed under these headings should be in alphabetical order, in
bold type, and separated by semicolons when there are more than one.
____

The allowed relationships are entered using this syntax:

[source,adoc]
----
related:{type}[term]
----

Where:

`type`:: is one of the following values.

`contrast`::: (generates "Contrast:") refers to a term with an opposite or substantially different meaning.

`equivalent`::: (generates "Syn:") refers to a term that has equivalent meaning.

`see`::: (generates "See:") refers to a term where the desired definition can be found.

`seealso`::: (generates "See also:") refers to a related term.

`term`:: is the name of the term to be referenced.

.Example of entering concept relationships
[example]
====
[source,adoc]
----
==== acceleration-insensitive drift rate
related:seealso[drift rate]
related:seealso[systematic drift rate]

The component of...

==== code set
related:see[coded character set]

==== coded character set
related:equivalent[code set]

==== input reference axis
related:contrast[output reference axis]

The direction of an axis.
----

Renders as:

____
*acceleration-insensitive drift rate*: The component of ... _See also_: *drift rate*; *systematic drift rate*.

*code set*: _See_: *coded character set*.

*coded character set*: A set of characters ... _Syn_: *code set*.

*input reference axis*: The direction of an axis. _Contrast_: *output reference axis*
____

====

For a concept that has multiple designations (terms), defined through the
`preferred:[...]` or `admitted:[...]` commands, Metanorma automatically
generates a "`Syn:`" relationship for the original designation and an additional
entry for the other designations with no definition but only contains a "`See:`"
that links back to the original.
