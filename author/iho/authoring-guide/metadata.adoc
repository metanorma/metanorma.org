== General

The header contains information about the document (metadata). You specify these
metadata by using predefined document attributes, that look like this:

[source,adoc]
----
:document-attribute: some-value
----

Most of the attributes take a value, while others are simple flags without a
value, like:

[source,adoc]
----
:novalid:
----

Some of the metadata will be visible in your document, such as `:title:`, while
others are not visible but still affect how your document is generated.

NOTE: The order of attributes does not matter in Metanorma.

== Specifying IHO metadata

In an IHO document, you can specify metadata about:

* Contributors: working group participants, ballot group members, standardization board members

* Document info: document type, document stages (draft, published, etc.).

* Dates: draft dates, revision dates, publishing date, copyright year, etc.

* Identifiers: document numbers, ISBNs, STD numbers

NOTE: Other metadata influence how the document is generated and should only be
used by advanced users. Please refer to the IHO document attributes.

At a minimum, you will need to specify:

* Title
* Metanorma document class as `iho`
* Document number
* Document type, and optionally subtype
* Document stage
* Committee
* Author or editor

NOTE: Please refer to reference documentation to see the full list of
link:/author/iho/ref/document-attributes/[IHO-specific document attributes].

NOTE: In this section, we may refer to the document header from the
https://github.com/metanorma/mn-samples-iho/[IHO sample documents].

// IHO example
== Document-specific attributes and basic operations

These are the basic document attributes for IHO.

.Setting basic document attributes for IHO
[example]
====
----
= Recommended Practice for Preparing an IHO Standards Draft <1>
:docnumber: 987.6 <2>
:docstage: draft <3>
:version: 3 <4>
----
<1> IHO document title.
<2> IHO document number. If draft, omit the "P" prefix as it will be
automatically added.
<3> IHO document stage.
<4> If `:docstage:` is draft, enter the draft number in `:version:`.
====

These are operational concerns that are useful for the author.

* `:mn-document-class:` must be set in order to set the flavor to IHO.

* `:mn-output-extensions:` determines what output to be produced.

.Setting IHO-specific attributes
[example]
====
----
:mn-document-class: iho <1>
:mn-output-extensions: xml,html,doc,pdf,rxl <2>
:local-cache-only: <3>
----
<1> Metanorma flavor. For IHO, enter `iho`.
<2> Metanorma output formats. For IHO, supported formats are `xml`, `html`, `pdf`, `doc` and `rxl`.
<3> Metanorma option to store data cache in the current directory.
====


== Document types and subtypes

IHO offers three types of documents that differ in the level of
the obligation of requirements.


The type is to be set via these two attributes:

`:doctype:`:: for the document type

`:docsubtype:`:: for the document subtype, necessary for certain `:doctypes:`

Document types, set using the `:doctype:` attribute, include:

`standard`:: This document is a Standard (default). This document provides
mandatory requirements.

`recommended-practice`:: This document is a Recommended Practice. This document
only provides recommendations, not requirements.

`guide`:: This document is a Guide. This document only provide guidelines, not
requirements.

For each of these types, modification documents can be issued by using
`:docsubtype:` with the following values:

`document`:: This document is the standardization deliverable itself. (default)

`amendment`:: This document details amendments made to the base document.

`corrigendum`:: This document details technical error corrections made to the base document.

`errata`:: This document details publication error corrections made to the base document.

.Setting document type
[example]
====
----
:doctype: standard <1>
----
<1> IHO document type.
====

.Setting document type with subtype for an Amendment
[example]
====
----
:doctype: standard
:docsubtype: amendment <1>
----
<1> IHO document subtype.
====


== Document stages and progress dates

IHO deliverables go through various stages of approval.

The document stage is set via the `:docstage:` attribute.

Typically, a document goes through these processes:

. Started off as a draft. where `:docstage: draft` is set, and draft number set
to 1 `:version: 1`. The `:copyright-year:` should always be set to the current year.

. Draft number increases, e.g. `:version: 2`, as the working group progresses.

. The draft gets balloted by the working group when ready.

. Once the balloting group approves the document, it will be represented
to the SA standardization board for approval.

. After approval, the date of approval should be entered as metadata
using `:issued-date:`.

. Once the document is ready to be published, set `:docstage: published` and
remove the `:version:` attribute.

NOTE: IHO documents can also be marked `inactive` by `:docstage: inactive`.

.Setting document stage and progress dates
[example]
====
----
:docstage: draft <1>
:version: 3 <2>
:copyright-year: 2021 <3>
:issued-date: 2021-01-01 <4>
----
<1> Document stage.
<2> Document draft number.
<3> Copyright year of document.
<4> Date of approval by the standards board.

== Authorship and other preface information

In IHO documents there are several types of contributor information to be
entered:

* society name
* standardization committee
* working group information
** name of working group
** members of working group
* balloting committee members
* SA standardization board members

In IHO, a working group operate under one of two modes:
"individual mode" or "entity mode".

If the working group operates under individual mode:

* the participants of the working mode should be entered, as individuals

If the working group operates under entity mode:

* the representatives of entities that are members of the working group
are to be entered;
* the individual participants of the working mode should be entered, as
individuals;
* the entity members of the working group should be entered.

// The individual contributors that created the document, this is set via the
// `:fullname:` and `:role:` attributes. Additional contributors are set by
// suffixing the attribute with a `_{n}` where {n} is a sequential number after 1,
// e.g. For `:fullname_2:` use `:role_2:`.
