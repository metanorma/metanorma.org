= Localization and T&Ds

In Terms and Definitions, preferred terms, alternate terms and deprecated terms
are expected to be given in both Chinese and English. By default, Metanorma-GB does
this by detecting space-delimited runs of Han or Latin script text:

[source,asciidoc]
--
alt:[rough rice 糙米]
--

[source,xml]
--
<admitted language="zh">糙米</admitted> <admitted language="en">rough rice</admitted>
--

However if there is script mixing in a term -- if the Chinese term contains
a Latin script acronym or a mathematical expression, for example -- the
Chinese term will not be detected correctly. To address this, the formatting macros
`+[zh]#...#+` and `+[en]#...#+` are used. If they are present, then the content
of those macros is treated as the Chinese and English equivalents of the
parent node instead:

[source,asciidoc]
--
=== [en]#XYZ paddy# [zh]#水稻XY#]
alt:[[en]#rough rice# [zh]#糙米#]
--

[source,xml]
--
<preferred language="en">XYZ paddy</preferred> <preferred language="zh">水稻XYZ</preferred>
<admitted language="zh">糙米</admitted> <admitted language="en">rough rice</admitted>
--

[IMPORTANT]
====
No further markup is permitted within the `+[zh]#...#+` and
`+[en]#...#+` macros, and AsciiDoc does not correctly nest
inline macros within other inline macros (so `+alt:[en:[_xyz_] zh:[xyz]+`
would not give correct behaviour either.)
====

Localization strings can be used anywhere else in the document where the
grammar permits localized strings (notably in bibliographic data). For example,
a bibliographic title can be given in two languages as follows.
(Note that formatting appears outside the language macros.)

[source,asciidoc]
--
[[[ISO7301,ISO 7301:2011]]], _[zh]#大米 - 规格# [en]#Rice -- Specification#_
--

[source,xml]
--
  <bibitem id="ISO7301" type="standard">
   <title language="zh">大米 - 规格</title> <title language="en">Rice&#x2011;Specification</title>
  <docidentifier>ISO 7301</docidentifier>
  <date type="published">

Metanorma-GB also supports `+[zh-Hant]#...#+` and `+[zh-Hans]#...#+` to
differentiate traditional and simplified script in ISOXML. `zh-Hant` is
provisionally supported through changing font in the output.
