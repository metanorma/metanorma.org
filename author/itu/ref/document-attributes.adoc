[NOTE]
====
Document attributes listed below are unique to the processing of ITU documents in Metanorma.

For _common document attributes_, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[Document attributes reference] in general Metanorma author's documentation. That page describes attributes that apply to all Metanorma flavors, not just ITU.

For an _introduction to Metanorma AsciiDoc document attributes_ and how Metanorma uses them, see link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[the corresponding topic].

== Document information

`doctype`::
Document type. Choices below.

`recommendation`::: (default) This document is an ITU Recommendation.
`recommendation-supplement`::: This document is a Supplement of an ITU Recommendation.
`recommendation-amendment`::: This document is an Amendment of an ITU Recommendation.
`recommendation-corrigendum`::: This document is a Corrigendum of an ITU Recommendation.
`recommendation-errata`::: This document is an Errata of an ITU Recommendation.
`recommendation-annex`::: This document is an Annex of an ITU Recommendation.
`focus-group`::: This document is the output of a Focus Group.
`implementers-guide`::: This document is an ITU Implementers Guide.
`technical-paper`::: This document is an ITU Technical Paper.
`technical-report`::: This document is an ITU Technical Report.
`joint-itu-iso-iec`::: This document is a "`Common Text`" Recommendation between ITU and ISO/IEC JTC 1.
`resolution`::: This document is an ITU Resolution.
`service-publication`::: This document is an ITU Service Publication (e.g. an Annex to the ITU Operational Bulletin).
`:handbook:`::: This document is an ITU Handbook.
`:question:`::: This document is an ITU Question.
`:contribution:`::: This document is an ITU Contribution.

`:status:`::
Document status. Synonym: `:docstage:`. Choices below.
+
--
`in-force`::: This document is In-force.
`in-force-prepublished`::: This document is In-force but the text is not final.
`superseded`::: This document has been superseded.
`withdrawn`::: This document has been withdrawn.

NOTE: If the document is a draft, use the general `:draft:` document
attribute instead of `:status:` to indicate so (see
link:/author/ref/document-attributes/[Document attributes reference]).

In general, the document stages are:

* Draft Recommendation (the text of the Recommendation is being developed and
may be quite mature, but it has not yet been approved)

* Once the text is mature, the SG may decide to "`Consent it`" (APP) or
"`Determine it`" (TAP). The draft Recommendation is then in "`Consented`" (AAP)
or "`Determined`" (TAP) state.

* As soon as it has been approved, the Recommendation is no longer a draft
Recommendation, but an in-force Recommendation.

* TSB then prepublishes the Recommendation. Prepublished Recommendations are
in-force texts that are not yet in their final form.
Because they are not final, they are made available only to the Membership.

* TSB copy-edits and publishes the Recommendation. This final in-force version
is made available to all for free download.

* If the Recommendation is revised, it will be superseded by the revision as
soon as the revision is approved.

* Recommendations are seldom withdrawn, but it may happen when the SG decides to
do so.

Please refer to the Traditional Approval Process (TAP) (https://www.itu.int/pub/T-RES-T.1-2016[WTSA Resolution 1])
and the Alternative Approval Process (AAP) (https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-A.8/en[Recommendation A.8])
for further details.

== Author Information

ITU documents are produced by editorial groups within a Bureau/Sector
(BDT: ITU-D, RRB: ITU-R, TSB: ITU-T).

ITU groups are hierarchically arranged, and represented in Metanorma through a
three-level encoding also used elsewhere in Metanorma: `group`, `subgroup` and
`workgroup` below the Bureau/Sector level.

Groups have types (e.g. `tsag`, `study-group`, `working-party`, `focus-group`),
and the same type of group can attach to different super-groups.

.Example of ITU group hierarchy
[example]
====
Both TSAG and Study Groups can have Focus Groups.
====

An ITU project group is specified using a 4 level encoding:

* `bureau` (or `sector`)
* `group`
* `subgroup`
* `workgroup`

There may be multiple project groups associated with a document. Each group
after the first is indicated by a trailing number, e.g. `bureau_2`, `group_2`.


On top of this structure, documents can respond to Questions, which are
allocated to Study Groups, and then worked on by Working Parties. Questions are
represented separately, outside the group hierarchical structure.


`:bureau_{i}:`::
Mandatory. Bureau that the document belongs to. Choices are listed below.

not apply [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-itu/releases/tag/v1.0.16].

`:edition:`:: In the case of Resolutions, this attribute is used to indicate whether the current

(Resolutions are identified through place and year, regardless of whether they constitute revisions
or not.)

`:complement-of:`:: Identifier of document that this is a complement or supplement of; used
in particular for recommendation supplements, to nominate the document or documents that this is a
supplement of [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-itu/releases/tag/v1.2.12]. Semicolon-delimited.

== Visual appearance

`:smartquotes:`::
In ITU, quotes and apostrophes default to straight.
When this attribute is set, Metanorma will convert quotes and apostrophes to smart quotes and smart apostrophes.
In the rest of Metanorma, if this attribute is not supplied, quotes and apostrophes default to "`smart`".

`:document-schema:`::
Used to specify the document scheme that this document aligns to [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-itu/releases/tag/v2.3.7].
If the value `legacy` is provided, the resulting behaviour is as with the document attribute `:legacy-do-not-insert-missing-sections:`.

"`Conventions`" if missing [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-itu/releases/tag/v1.0.11]. +

Use this if you have a legacy Recommendation document with clauses with names preceding this requirement
(e.g. "`Prerequisites`", "`Process`", "`General`"), and you do not want the compulsory new sections
to be added in at the start of the document.

`:hierarchical-object-numbering:`::
If set, do not number objects (tables, figures etc.) consecutively throughout the body of the
document, but restart numbering with each clause
(hierarchically) [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-itu/releases/tag/v1.0.11]. +
+
Use in complex documents, with multiple tables or figures, that need to be tracked against
clauses for ease of lookup (so _Figure 6-3, 6-4_, instead of _Figure 21, 22_.)
Note that equations in ITU are always numbered hierarchically.

`:coverpage-image:`::
Comma-delimited list of image locations, for images to be included on the PDF
cover page of ITU "Service Publications" (and title page for logos). All image
locations are relative to the source
document. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-itu/releases/tag/v1.0.16].
