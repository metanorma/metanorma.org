= Introduction to Metanorma AsciiDoc

// tag::tutorial[]

Metanorma documents are written in AsciiDoc, a markup language that annotates
text with processing instructions for layout.

Since AsciiDoc only consists of plain text, you can use any editor to create
AsciiDoc files (`.adoc` files).

AsciiDoc is very similar to Markdown or Wiki formatting but provides more
precise markup for creating text documents, for example to create a bibliography
section or an index.

Because Metanorma fulfills the markup requirements of SDOs, Metanorma extends
plain AsciiDoc. This version of AsciiDoc is called Metanorma AsciiDoc.

An AsciiDoc document consists of different levels of granularity:

* The document head (also called the header)
* Sections
* Blocks
* Inline markup

The https://asciidoctor.org/docs/user-manual/[Asciidoctor manual] provides ample
information about the general markup mechanisms of typical AsciiDoc.

== Unsupported AsciiDoc features

While Metanorma mostly *adds* functionality to the AsciiDoc markup language,
there are also some mechanisms, that Metanorma does not support:

* Sidebars (``aside``s) are not supported. Instead, they are used for
link:/author/topics/reviewing[reviewer comments].

* Page breaks (`thematic break`) are only supported in select flavors.

* ASCII art/preformatted text (`literal`) are only supported in select
flavors.
