== General

For references to certain standards, Metanorma will attempt to look up references online
during document build automatically.

https://www.relaton.org/[Relaton] is used to look up the reference details for
standards known to have online bibliographic sources.

NOTE: Some online bibliographic sources from supported standards bodies
directly serve Relaton bibliographic data formats (e.g. Relaton XML, Relaton YAML).


== Reference lookup syntax

For bibliographic standards to be looked up via Relaton,
the standard document identifier needs to be encoded in a format recognized by Relaton as a key:

ISO deliverables:: `ISO(identifier)`, or any identifier prefixed with `ISO`

IEC deliverables:: `IEC(identifier)`, or any identifier prefixed with `IEC`.
For the IEC Electropedia termbank (IEV), simply use `IEV`.

ITU deliverables:: `ITU(identifier)` (e.g. `ITU(H.265)`), or any identifier prefixed with `ITU`

IETF documents:: `IETF(identifier)` (e.g. `IETF(I-D.-burger-xcon-mmodels)`), or any identifier prefixed with `RFC`

NIST documents:: `NIST(identifier)` (e.g. `NIST(SP 800-116r1)`, `NIST FIPS 202`), or any identifier prefixed with `NIST`

OGC documents:: `OGC(identifier)` (e.g. `OGC(14-083r2)`, `OGC 14-083r2`), or any identifier prefixed with `OGC`

Chinese standards:: `CN(identifier)` (e.g. `CN(JB/T 13368-2018)`)

[[iso-iec-dir-syntax]] ISO/IEC Directives::
`ISO/IEC DIR {n}`, `ISO/IEC DIR {n} + {flavor} SUP`, or `ISO/IEC DIR {flavor} SUP`.
`n`::: is the number of directive
`flavor`::: is either `ISO` or `IEC`.
+
The following references are supported at this time:
+
* `ISO/IEC DIR 1 IEC SUP`: "`Procedures for the technical work -- Procedures specific to IEC`"
* `ISO/IEC DIR 1 ISO SUP`: "`Consolidated ISO Supplement -- Procedures specific to ISO`"
* `ISO/IEC DIR 1`: "`Procedures for the technical work`"
* `ISO/IEC DIR 2 IEC`: "`Principles and rules for the structure and drafting of ISO and IEC documents`"
* `ISO/IEC DIR 2 ISO`: "`Principles and rules for the structure and drafting of ISO and IEC documents`"
* `ISO/IEC DIR IEC SUP`: "`Procedures specific to IEC`"
* `ISO/IEC DIR JTC 1 SUP`: "`Procedures specific to JTC 1`"
+
NOTE: These bibliographic entries are provided via the <<static-entry-cache>> as their
metadata are not available in machine-readable format online.
Documents in the <<static-entry-cache>> may differ from the latest online version.

The full bibliographic details of the item are automatically fetched from
the authoritative online bibliography source, and inserted into a Relaton XML
file stored locally.

NOTE: Only parts of the bibliographic details are used to render the reference
in Metanorma, namely: document identifier, title, publication date.

[[nofetch]]
== Disabling automatic lookup

=== For entire document

The presence of the link:/author/ref/document-attributes/#reference-lookup[`:no-isobib:`]
document attribute will disable the `isobib` bibliographic lookup engine for the
entire document:

* Bibliographic items will not be automatically looked up via `isobib`;
* The `isobib` bibliographic caches are not used.

=== For a bibliographic item

To turn off automatic lookup for a particular bibliographic item, simply wrap
the individual reference identifier in `nofetch(...)`, then the reference details for that
item are not looked up, though other items still will be [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.3.8].

== Citing from termbanks

=== General

Relaton is also used to automatically fetch references from termbanks.

The only supported termbank today is the IEV.

=== International Electrotechnical Vocabulary (IEV, the IEC 60500 series)

If any entries in Terms and Definitions cite terms sourced from the http://www.electropedia.org[IEV Electropedia],
it is queried during validation to retrieve the correct citation information
for creating the reference.

[source,asciidoc]

[bibliography]
== Bibliography

* [[[ievterms,IEV]]]

These queries are routed through the `iev` gem.


== Lookup result caching

=== General

Fetching every single reference with web queries can be slow,
especially for larger documents across multiple compilation runs.

NOTE: Each web query may take a few seconds per reference, depending
on connection/service speed and delay.

Metanorma supports Relaton entry caching, for which a Relaton
database is created to store fetched bibliographic items (the "`cache store`").

The cache store(s) enable reuse of previously fetched bibliographic items
so they do not need to be re-fetched each time a document is processed.

This is especially helpful in these conditions:

* Internet connectivity is unavailable (e.g. on a plane without WiFi);
* the online bibliographic source goes temporarily offline or awry (e.g. maintenance, upgrades).

NOTE: Relaton cache stores are realized in form of a directory.


=== Caching at the system-level (global cache)

Results of reference lookups made across all documents
are cached in the global cache store `~/.relaton/cache`.


=== Caching at the directory-level (local cache)

The local cache is enabled by setting the
link:/author/ref/document-attributes/#caching[`:local-cache:` or `:local-cache-only:` document attributes].

If enabled, the results of all Relaton searches done to date in
a given directory are stored in the local cache store.

The local cache is normally created at the default location `relaton/cache`
relative to the top-level Metanorma file.

To override this location, a value can be given to the
`:local-cache:` or `:local-cache-only:` attribute.
This specified directory name will be used to create the local cache store.

The local cache overrides entries in the global cache, and can be
manually edited.

Due to its nature being a portable directory, it is simple to
transfer bibliographic entries to other authors or systems
for reproducible compilation.

It is also often used for creating a self-sufficient,
immediately compilable Metanorma document package for interchange.

Last but not least, the local cache store can be committed
into version control systems (e.g. Git) for faster (and more reproducible)
continuous integration build times. It also prevents CI build failures
caused by bibliographic sources being temporarily unavailable.

[[static-entry-cache]]
=== Static entry cache

The static entry cache is distributed with the `relaton` gem and always enabled.
It contains bibliographic entries that are often used but cannot be obtained
in machine-readable formats online. See <<iso-iec-dir-syntax>> for entries
of this type.

To add a new document to the static entry cache, please create an issue
on https://github.com/relaton/relaton/issues.


=== Disabling caching

If the document attribute `:no-isobib-cache:` is set, the reference details for
items are still looked up via `isobib`, but the `isobib` caches are not used.


=== Caching of undated references

Any entry in the cache that corresponds to an undated reference fetches its details
from the latest available entry at the bibliographic source.

=== Cache expiry

If the entry is more than 60 days old, it is refetched.

=== Caching of IEV entries

The results of all `iev` searches done to date across all documents are cached
in the global Relaton cache file at `~/.relaton/cache`.

The results of all `iev` searches done to date in a given directory
are stored in the same directory as the current document,
by default to the cache store `iev/cache`.

IEV entries in a local cache will be stored under the local Relaton cache store,
whose location can be changed as mentioned above.

The directory name for the IEV cache is the Relaton cache store's location
with inner directory `_iev`.
