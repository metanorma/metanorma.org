This is the list of document attributes supported by all flavors of Metanorma.

[TIP]
====
If you're using one of the link:/flavors/[officially supported flavors of Metanorma],
please also see flavor-specific guidance for any additional supported or
required document attributes.
====

== Build and validation

`:nodoc:`::
Instructs Metanorma to not generate Word and HTML output, means only XML output will be generated.

`:novalid:`::
Suppress document validation.

`:index-terms:`::
Terms (and symbols) are indexed automatically in postprocessing.
See link:/author/topics/inline_markup/index_terms#auto-index-terms[automatic terms indexing]. [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.11.3]

`:log-filter-severity:`::
Filter from error log all warnings at the given severity level or above it.
See link:/author/topics/output/validation[Validation] for valid values.
 [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.9.7]


`:log-filter-category:`::
Filter from error log all warnings belonging to one of the named categories; comma-delimited.
See link:/author/topics/output/validation[Validation] for valid values.
 [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.9.7]


== Reference lookup

For bibliographic lookup, see link:/author/basics/reference-lookups[automatic reference lookup].

`:no-isobib:`::
If set, do not use the `relaton` or `iev` gem functionality to look up
ISO and IEV references online, nor the cache of `relaton` and `iev` searches.

== Caches

For bibliographic caches, see link:/author/basics/reference-lookups/#lookup-result-caching[lookup result caching].

`:no-isobib-cache:`::
If set, use the `relaton` and `iev` gem functionality to look up
ISO and IEV references online, but do not use the cache of `relaton` and `iev` searches.

`:local-cache:`::
Use the local Relaton and iev search caches to override the global `relaton` and `iev` search
caches. If a directory name is given for the attribute, that name overrides `relaton` as the
cache name.

`:local-cache-only:`::
Use the local Relaton and iev search caches to the exclusion of the global
`relaton` and `iev` search caches.
If a directory name is given for the attribute, that name overrides `relaton` as the cache name.

`:flush-caches:`::
If set, delete and reinitialise the cache of https://www.relaton.org/[Relaton] searches.

`:relaton-data-source`::
Allows specification of an external bibliographic file to be
imported [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/2.2.9].
The value of the field is the file name. If the format also needs to be
specified, this is done as `file=PATH/TO/FILE,format=FORMAT`. Valid formats are
follows.

`bibtex`::: The BibTeX format. Currently, only
this is supported as a format, all other formats will raise an error.

`:relaton-data-source-{id}`::
Allows specification of multiple external bibliographic files to be
imported [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/2.2.9].
The different bibliographic sources are differentiated through the value of the `{id}` identifier.

+
NOTE: Prior to 2.7.0, this field accepted semicolon-delimited values [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.7.0].
These are processed via CSV, recognising quote marks. This functionality is maintained in later versions,
but other attributes of organisations are ignored (`publisher_logo`, `pub-address`, etc.)

`:publisher_logo_{i}:`:: The logo of the publisher, specified as an image file; the numbers in the attribute
align to the `:publisher_{i}:` attributes [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.7.0].

[[docnumber]] `:docnumber:`::
The numeric component of the document identifier.
The full identifier is formed by prefixing and suffixing this element with other strings
derived from metadata.

`:docidentifier:`::
As an alternative to `docnumber` and other attributes (such as `doctype` and `docstage`),
which form the full identifier by combining multiple attributes, this attribute contains a
full specification of the document identifier and overrides the composition of the document
identifier [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.3.9].
This value is used for document identifiers that do not follow normal SDO conventions,
including for documents that are adoptions from other SDOs.

`:docidentifier-additional:`::
This attribute provides additional primary identifiers for the document, to be used alongside
the native identifier generated from `docnumber` or `docidentifier` [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.8.2].
It is intended for copublished standards with multiple primary identifiers.
The list of identifiers is comma-delimited, and is specified as TYPE:VALUE; e.g.
`:docidentifier-additional: IDF:IDF 21, RFC:RFC 97`

`:edition:`::
The document edition.

`:revdate:`::
The date the document was last updated.

`:library-ics:`::
The ICS (International Categorization for Standards) number for the standard.
There may be more than one ICS for a document; if so, they should be comma-delimited.
(The ICS identifier is added to the document metadata,
but may not be visible in the resulting document, depending on Metanorma flavor.)

`:isbn:`::
The ISBN-13 number of the document [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.6.2].
This value is optional.

`:isbn10:`::
The ISBN-10 number of the document [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.6.2]
This value is optional.

`:title:`::

for example, `:title-en:`, `:title-fr`:).

`:doctype:`::
The document type; e.g. "standard", "guide", "report".

`:docsubtype:`::
The document subtype; by default, used to provide an ad hoc, user defined document class,
unless provided for explicitly in the flavour,
as in OGC [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.9.1]

`:status:`:: The status of the document; e.g. "draft", "published".
Synonym: `:docstage:`.

`:docsubstage:`:: The substage code for the document status, where applicable.

`:iteration:`:: The iteration of a stage, in case there have been multiple drafts
(e.g. `2` on a `CD`: this is the second iteration through the `CD` stage).

`:keywords:`::
Comma-delimited list of keywords associated with the document.

`:classification:`::
Comma-delimited list of classification tokens, expressed as `type:value` pairs; if no prefix is given to a value,
"default" is supplied as the type [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v1.9.1].
There can only be one value per type in a token; if there are multiple classification values of the same type,
repeat the type in a new token; e.g.  `:classification: Dewey:563.5.081, Dewey:537.71`.

[[draft]] `:draft:`::
The document draft.
Used in addition to document stage.
The value must provide the exact draft iteration in _X.Y_ format
(major version number and minor version number separated by a dot).
If present, link:/author/topics/blocks/annotations[reviewer notes]
will be rendered (otherwise those are suppressed).

`:document-scheme:`::
Document content arrangement that Metanorma will enforce for this document.
+
Accepted values are flavour-specific.
+
Depending on the document scheme, Metanorma may insert clauses with
predetermined text and orders clauses in accordance with the style prescribed by
the SDO. If those styles are updated, this attribute indicates to Metanorma
which iteration of the prescription to
enforce [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.1.6].
+
NOTE: As of this writing, implemented in the IEEE, BSI, ITU and ISO flavours.

== Generic metadata

Metanorma allows generic metadata to be passed to the generated document in key/value form, for downstream
use [added in https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma-standoc/releases/tag/v2.0.1].
This metadata needs to be indicated as either semantic, or presentation-related. The name of the metadata
value is included in the document attribute:

`:semantic-metadata-{name}:`::
Comma-delimited list of values, relating to `name` as semantic metadata about the document.
Stored in the document under `//metanorma-extension/semantic-metadata/{name}`, with repeating tags for each value.

`:presentation-metadata-{name}:`::
Comma-delimited list of values, relating to `name` as presentation metadata about the document.
Stored in the document under `//metanorma-extension/presentation-metadata/{name}`, with repeating tags for each value.

[[document-relations]]
== Document relations

=== General

These attributes takes a document identifier in the Relaton format:

* If the document can be found via Relaton auto-fetch (e.g. a published IEC standard), the actual bibliographic item will be used.
* Otherwise, a dummy bibliographic item with an empty title and the nominated document identifier will be used.

Multiple document identifiers can be delimited by `;`. If the document cannot be auto-fetched,
a title for each document nominated can be introduced, delimited from the document identifier
by `,`. For example, `NIST SP 800-1,Title 1;NIST SP 800-2,Title 2`.

=== Part of

`:part-of:`:: document identifier that the current document is a part of.

This document attribute applies to a document part in order to point to the parent document.

words are broken up every 10 characters on punctuation (e.g. URIs on / ),
and every 20 characters if there is no puncutation in the word,
in order to deal with very narrow columns. (Because the break is zero-width,
it will not be visible unless it coincides with the end of a column.)
