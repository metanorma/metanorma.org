References are an integral part of standards. The main mechanism for references are anchors and destinations. There are four types of references:

* Hyperlinks to an external source, for example a link to a website
* Metadata references
* Internal references to a section, image, table, etc.
* link:/author/basics/entering-bib[Bibliographic entries]

== Hyperlinks

AsciiDoc lets you include links to external sources, and sources to files within the same project.

//Source file contains text between that's not tagged for tutorials

To reference an *internal* source:

. Use the https://docs.asciidoctor.org/asciidoc/latest/macros/link-macro/[link macro] to include a link to a file. The syntax looks like this: `\link:PATH[]`.
. Add link text in square brackets after the path.
+

Download the latest link:downloads/report.pdf[Report]!
----

To reference an *external* source:

. Paste the URL into the document.
. Add link text in square brackets after the URL (optional) `URL[Link text]`.
+

== Metadata references

Every document contains a set of metadata to describe the document. You can insert a metadata reference by putting the attribute in curly braces `{attribute}`. The reference will be replaced with the value in the rendered output.

:subcommittee-number: 11
:subcommittee: Fasteners with metric external thread

This document was prepared by Technical Committee ISO/TC {technical-committee-number}, _{technical-committee}_, Subcommittee SC {subcommittee-number}, _{subcommittee}_.

== Internal references
//create new screenshots and update example
To link to an important section, table, figure, formula, or list item in your document:

. Set an anchor using double square brackets before the content you want to reference: `\[[anchor]]`.
+

.Typical gelatinization curve
image::images/rice_image2.png[Image of the gelatinization curve]
----
+
.Rendered image caption
image::/assets/author/learn/references_img_anchor.jpg[]

. To reference an anchor, type the anchor name like this `\<<anchor>>`.
+

.Rendered reference

. To set an alternative text other than the anchor text, append the text inside the brackets using a comma.

// Include in Auto Numbering topic??
=== Auto-numbering of references
Metanorma automatically numbers and names references; because they are autonumbered, they will be renumbered automatically if you insert any new text of the same type.

Since the markup will be converted into XML, the anchor must follow the https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-names11/[XML namespace conventions]. Therefore, an anchor name name must not contain:

* colons
* whitespaces
* words starting with numbers

// Link will only work with new info architecture
If you want to learn more about the technical aspects of cross-references, read link:author/basics/xrefs[Deep-dive into cross-references].

== Bibliographic entries
//include::/author/topics/sections/entering_bib.adoc[tag=tutorial]

Most standard documents contain two sections with bibliographic references, namely the “normative references” and the “bibliography” (informative references).
Every bibliographic section must be preceded by the style attribute `[bibliography]` so that bibliographic references are recognized as such.

== Entering a bibliographic entry
To enter a reference entry:

. Start a new unordered list (`*`) item.
. Enter triple square brackets (`[[[]]]`) which contain:
+
* The anchor name used to reference this entry
* A document identifier

+
.Syntax for a bibliographic entry
[source, AsciiDoc]
----
* [[[anchor,document identifier or reference tag]]], _reference list text_
----

. After the triple brackets, you may include the reference text in italics, for example the title of the document.
+
NOTE: Metanorma uses https://www.relaton.org/[Relaton] to link:author/basics/reference-lookups[automatically fetch resource descriptions] from the SDO's web site. If Metanorma recognizes a document identifier, it will overwrite any title you provide with the authoritative title of the reference.

== Referencing a bibliographic entry
To cite an entry from your bibliography:app-name:

. Enter the anchor name like this: `\<<ISO20483>>`.
. To specify a location within the cited document, you can add link:/author/topics/sections/bibliography/#localities[localities] in the brackets like so: `\<<ISO20483, part=IV,chapter=3,paragraph=12>>`.

== Bibliography example

The following code sample illustrates how a bibliography section looks like in AsciiDoc Metanorma.

== Normative references

* [[[ISO20483,ISO 20483:2013]]], _Cereals and cereal products -- Determination of moisture content -- Reference method_
* [[[ISO6540,ISO 6540:1980]]]. _Maize -- Determination of moisture content (on milled grains and on whole grains)_
----
Gets rendered as:

* ISO 20483:2013. _Cereals and cereal products — Determination of moisture content — Reference method_
* ISO 6540:1980. _Maize — Determination of moisture content (on milled grains and on whole grains)_
