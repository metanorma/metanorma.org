== Specifications

=== General, organoleptic and health characteristics

Kernels of rice, whether parboiled, husked or milled, and whether whole or broken, shall be sound, clean and free from foreign odours or odour which indicates deterioration.

The levels of additives and pesticide residues and other contaminants shall not exceed the maximum limits permitted in the country of destination.

The presence of living insects which are visible to the naked eye is not permitted. This should be determined before separating the bulk sample into test samples.

=== Physical and chemical characteristics

==== {blank}

The mass fraction of moisture, determined in accordance with <<ISO712>>, using an oven complying with the requirements of <<IEC61010-2>>, shall not be greater than 15 %.footnote:[Formerly denoted as 15 % (m/m).]

//Convert table1 into an internal reference
The mass fraction of extraneous matter and defective kernels in husked and milled rice, whether or not parboiled, shall not be greater than the values specified in table1. 

NOTE: Lower mass fractions of moisture are sometimes needed for certain destinations depending on the climate, duration of transport and storage. For further details, see <<ISO6322-1>>, <<ISO6322-2>> and <<ISO6322-3>>.

// Create an internal reference to table1 
The defect tolerance for the categories considered shall not exceed the limits given in table1.

NOTE: This table is based on <<ISO7301,Table 1>>.

NOTE: Some commercial contracts require information in addition to that provided in this table.

NOTE: Only full red husked (cargo) rice is considered in this table.
