== Introduction

This is the Metanorma project site (a Ribose Open Project Site)
located at https://www.metanorma.org.

It is implemented as a https://jekyllrb.com[Jekyll] site with `jekyll-theme-open-project` theme.

=== Custom features

When adding a blog post, it’s possible to have an illustration that is replaced on hover
with another illustration. To do that, use the following markup:

[source,asciidoc]
--
[.hoverable]
.Image title
[link="/assets/blog/image-1-on-hover.png"]
image::/assets/blog/image-1.png[Alt text]
--

And make sure widget JS is included via post’s frontmatter:
[source,yaml]
--
extra_scripts:
  - src: /assets/js/hoverable-illustrations.js
--

== Content management

=== Adding a flavor

. **Settle on flavor and markup abbreviations.**
+
- _Flavor abbreviation_ is _not_ typically the same as organization abbreviation;
  usually it ends with “D”—e.g., M3AAWG is M3AAWG’s flavor abbreviation.
+
IMPORTANT: The `--type` flag given to Metanorma-CLI is expected to reference the same flavor abbreviation in lowercase.
- _Markup abbreviation_ usually takes the form of `Ascii<uppercase flavor abbreviation>`.

. **Settle on flavor authoring docs structure.**
  Metanorma flavor documentation is usually split into following sections:
+
- Getting started (markup mostly auto-generated)
- Sample document play guide
- One or more pages offering _topic guides_:
  how sections are formatted, how references are formatted,
  any specifics about build, etc.
- One or more pages offering _reference guides_: a complete list of custom document attributes
  (either new attributes or attributes which behave differently compared to “base” Metanorma),
  a list of unsupported AsciiDoc features, etc.
+
[TIP]
====
As a rule, it is helpful to provide different angles through both topics and references:
former for newer authors, and latter for more experienced authors.

Really simple flavors can omit separate topics/references sections
and just provide a single authoring guide page with any specifics.

Metanorma-IETF shows an example of more complex flavor docs,
Metanorma-M3AAWG shows an example of more basic flavor docs.
====

. **Create flavor authoring docs entry page.**
  Place `<lowercase flavor abbreviation>.adoc` under `author/`, with following contents:
+
[source,yaml]
--
---
layout: <lowercase flavor abbreviation>-flavor <1>
title: Metanorma for <uppercase flavor abbreviation>
---
:page-liquid:

{% include flavor-quickstart-steps.adoc flavor=layout.<lowercase flavor abbreviation>_flavor %}
--
<1> We will define that layout shortly.

. **Create flavor authoring docs.**
  Create a directory `author/<lowercase flavor abbreviation>/` (flavor docs root)
  and place .adoc files inside according to desired documentation structure.
  _All files_ should specify frontmatter with the same layout as flavor docs entry page.
+
- If topic and reference guides will be provided, index pages `topics.adoc` and `ref.adoc`
  should be provided under flavor docs root (can omit content).
  Topic and reference guide documents must live under correspondingly named sibling directories,
  `topics/` and `ref/`.
- Sample document guide should be placed in `sample.adoc`.
  It’s suggested to ensure that your _sample document build process_ is consistent with other
  flavors, and that you use includes to avoid repetition, though you can provide custom
  instructions if needed.
  See `author/m3aawg/sample.adoc` for an example with default basic build instructions (via include),
  and `author/iso/sample.adoc` for an example with custom build instructions.

. **Add implementing gem** under `_software/`,
  filename should reflect the actual package (gem) identifier,
  usually it would be `metanorma-<lowercase flavor abbreviation>.adoc`.
+
See e.g. `_software/metanorma-ietf.adoc` for an example.

. If defined, **add data model spec** under `_specs/`,
  filename should reflect repository name,
  usually it would be `metanorma-model-<lowercase flavor abbreviation>.adoc`.
+
See e.g. `_specs/metanorma-model-iso.adoc` for an example.

. **Create layout** named `<lowercase flavor abbreviation>-flavor.adoc`.
  The layout will contain extensive frontmatter and no content of its own,
  only the `{{ content }}` placeholder.
+
Layout frontmatter structure is shown below.
Fill in placeholders in angular brackets,
square brackets denote optional elements:
+
[source,yaml]
----
layout: flavor
docs_title: Metanorma for <uppercase flavor abbreviation>
title: Write <organization abbreviation> <documents|standards> with Metanorma

<lowercase flavor abbreviation>_flavor:
  base_url: /author/<lowercase flavor abbreviation>
  title: <uppercase flavor abbreviation>
  title_org: <organization abbreviation>
  title_org_full: <full organization name, unpacking abbreviations>
  markup_name: <markup abbreviation>

  # Should be identical to filename (no extension) of the entry under `_software`
  # corresponding to the gem implementing the flavor.

    # (optional)
    # If you have self-containing HTML file showcasing built sample document for the new flavor,
    # you can place it under `_pages/`, and reference filename here this way:
    rendered_url: https://www.metanorma.org/<built-sample-html-filename>/
    # …or, if it’s available elsewhere, this way:
    rendered_url: https://metanorma.github.io/…/

== Development

=== Getting started

* Ensure you have reasonable Ruby version
* Run `bundle` from within site directory to install Ruby dependencies

=== Serving site preview

* Run `jekyll serve` from within site directory


=== Structure

This repository contains a `_config.yml` for specifying the directory structure,
metadata, build defaults, etc.

Site data is located in this directory and the resulting build is created
under `_site/`.

==== Inputs

All source files are inside the `_jekyll/` directory, as specified in
`_config.yml`.

==== Outputs

All output files live inside the `_site/` directory, and its content have been
`gitignore`-d.



== Usage

=== Preparation

To begin developing,

[source,sh]
----
make prep
----

which would install the necessary Ruby gems for you.

=== Auto-build

To make it watch for file changes and build automatically (which watches only
the files specified in the above Inputs section), run:

[source,sh]
----
make watch
----

If you want to be sure all outputs are cleaned prior to building, run:

[source,sh]
----
make clean-watch
----

=== Just build

The non-watching equivalents for the above are simply:

[source,sh]
----
make build
----

[source,sh]
----
make clean-build
----


== Deployment

This section is only for deployment.

=== Configuration

Configure the hostname and region in the `ro-site.rc` file as you know it.

[source,sh]
----
cp ro-site.rc.template ro-site.rc
vi ro-site.rc
----

=== Uploading to S3

If you have access to the bucket, run this.

[source,sh]
----
export AWS_PROFILE=myprofile
source ro-site.rc
make upload
----

=== Clear CloudFront caching

The sites are accessed via CloudFront. If you're seeing
stale data after `make upload`, most likely the CloudFront
cache needs to be invalidated.

Your AWS account must be authorized to invalidate the CloudFront
cache for this distribution.

[source,sh]
----
export AWS_PROFILE=myprofile
source ro-site.rc
make clear-cf
----


== Workflow

. Ensure tests pass
. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b my-new-feature`)
. Commit your changes (`git commit -am 'Add some feature'`)
. Push to the branch (`git push origin my-new-feature`)
. Create new Pull Request
