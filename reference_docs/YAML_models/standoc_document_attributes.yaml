# How to use this template:
# Within the document_attributes section, there are several key value pairs to model a reference entry.
# A complete reference entry looks like this:
# nameOfTheAttribute: # Unique across document attributes for a flavor
#   tags: []  # A list of strings; Include flavor and type of attribute, e.g. "Author info"
#   title: "name of the attribute"
#   description: "Can contain inline and block AsciiDoc formatting."
#   required: true #Describes if the attribute is required to generate a well-formed doc or optional. Takes a boolean.
#   declaration: ":attribute:" #How the attribute is invoked
#   value_spec: "Comma-delimited list of classification tokens, expressed as `type:value` pairs. The `type:` prefix is optional, where omitted `default:` prefix is auto-supplied"
#   value_default: null  #OPTIONAL A string showing literal value for this attribute, without quotes. If the attribute doesn't take a values, this stays empty.
#   added_in_version: v1.9.1 # Could be auto-inferred, however the renderer might run into trouble, see https://github.com/metanorma/metanorma.org/wiki/Flavor-reference-structure-specification
#   example: >- ...  #OPTIONAL Should be pure AsciiDoc. Will be rendered as is inside an example block.
